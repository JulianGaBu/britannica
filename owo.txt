In 1870 the east-west and north-south railroads met at this point; the city was founded there the following year by a land company backed by railroad officials. Named for Birmingham, England, it developed as the iron and steel centre of the South. The city’s industrialization was based primarily on abundant local deposits of coal, limestone, and iron ore, essential for making steel. Dolomite, marble, barites, bauxite, pyrite, quartz, millstone, clays, sand, and gravel were also found in the area. Birmingham’s most important products are iron, steel, and related manufactures (including cast-iron pipe and wrought-iron furniture). The city’s industrial trend is toward diversification, and other products include aircraft parts, fire extinguishers, chemicals, paint, electronics, furniture, paper products, automotive parts, plastics, and textiles. Coal mining and high-technology industries also contribute to the economy. Education, government, banking, and health care are the chief service industries. From nearby Port Birmingham an inland waterway leads southward to the seaport of Mobile on the Gulf of Mexico.[P2]The city is the seat of several institutions of higher education, the largest of which, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, is a unit (founded 1969) of the state university system.

Alabama"Huntsville"City"Madison county"northern Alabama"Huntsville, city, seat (1808) of Madison county, northern Alabama, U.S. It is situated in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains near the Tennessee River, about 100 miles (160 km) north of Birmingham.[P1]Testing at the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.NASA Marshall Space Flight Center[ML1]It was originally called Twickenham by planter Leroy Pope for the home of his kinsman, Alexander Pope, the English poet. It was incorporated in 1811 and was renamed for John Hunt of Virginia, a Revolutionary War veteran who first settled the area in 1805 around a large spring. Huntsville was the site (1819) of Alabama’s first constitutional convention and served briefly as the state capital. In the 19th century it was a commercial centre for hay, cotton, corn, and tobacco, although its economic base was destroyed by Union forces (April 1862) during the American Civil War. Textile production became important after the war.[P2]The Redstone Arsenal complex (established 1941), including the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (1960) and related industries and research projects, greatly stimulated the city’s growth during and after World War II, and Huntsville became the centre of the country’s rocket and missile development. The city now has a diverse economy, with agriculture (including cotton, soybeans, and livestock), services (especially health care and education), manufacturing (including electronics, computer products, spacecraft, and tires), high-technology industries, and the military all making major contributions. The University of Alabama in Huntsville (1950) is located there, as is Oakwood University (1896). Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (1875) is in suburban Normal.[P3]Attractions in the city include Alabama Constitution Village, commemorating the 1819 convention; Burritt Museum and Park, home to a 1937 mansion and exhibits on local history; Twickenham Historic District, which contains the state’s largest group of antebellum structures; and the Huntsville Museum of Art. Just outside the city is the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, which features missiles, rockets, and other space-related exhibits and conducts a week-long space camp program. Huntsville has ballet and opera companies and a symphony orchestra. Annual events include the arts festival Panoply in April and the music festival Big Spring Jam in September.

Alabama"Jasper"City"Walker county"northwestern Alabama"Jasper, city, seat (1824) of Walker county, northwestern Alabama, U.S., about 40 miles (65 km) northwest of Birmingham. Settled in 1815, it was named for Sergeant William Jasper, a defender of Fort Moultrie (then Fort Sullivan) during the American Revolution. It developed after the arrival of the Kansas City, Memphis and Birmingham and the Sheffield and Birmingham railroads in 1886. Coal, timber, and poultry processing are the major contributors to the city’s economy. The manufacture of furniture is also important. William B. Bankhead, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives (1936–40), and his actress daughter, Tallulah Bankhead, lived in Jasper. William B. Bankhead National Forest is 15 miles (24 km) north.

Alabama"Marion"City"Perry county"west-central Alabama"Marion, city, seat (1822) of Perry county, west-central Alabama, U.S. It is situated near the Cahaba River, about midway between Tuscaloosa (northwest) and Montgomery (southeast). Settled in 1817, it was known as Muckle’s Ridge until it was renamed to honour Francis Marion, a soldier in the American Revolution who was known as the Swamp Fox. A resolution adopted by Alabama Baptists meeting in Marion in November 1844 was an early step in the controversy over slavery that led to the separation of Baptists into Northern and Southern factions the following year. Light industry (including poultry processing and the manufacture of packaging and metal products) is the economic mainstay. Judson College was founded in 1838, and Marion Military Institute was established in 1842. Nearby (north and east) is the Oakmulgee Division of Talladega National Forest.

Alabama"Mobile"City"Mobile county"southwestern Alabama"Mobile, city, seat (1812) of Mobile county, southwestern Alabama, U.S. It lies on Mobile Bay (an arm of the Gulf of Mexico) at the mouth of the Mobile River and is a river port and Alabama’s only seaport.[P1]MobileCathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Mobile, Ala.Altairisfar[ML1]The site was explored by Spaniards as early as 1519. In 1702 French colonists under Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville established a fort 27 miles (43 km) above the river mouth. The fort was moved to the present site in 1711, and the town that was built there served as the capital of French Louisiana until about 1719. It was named for the local Mobile (or Maubilla) Indians. In 1763 the town was ceded to the British. During the American Revolution, Spanish forces under the leadership of Bernardo de Gálvez captured Mobile. It was seized by the United States during the War of 1812, but because it was then a part of West Florida Mobile’s status was not finally clarified until a treaty was signed between the United States and Spain in 1819.[P2]During the American Civil War, Mobile was one of the most important Confederate ports, and it maintained its trade with the West Indies and Europe despite a Union blockade begun in 1861. The port functioned until August 1864, when the Battle of Mobile Bay, fought between the opposing Union and Confederate fleets, was won by the Union admiral David Farragut. Two forts at the bay’s entrance, Fort Gaines on Dauphin Island and Fort Morgan on Mobile Point, surrendered immediately thereafter. In the spring of 1865 the Union general Edward R.S. Canby successfully laid siege to Fort Blakely and Spanish Fort, on the east side of the bay. After 26 days the forts, and then the city, were evacuated, and Union forces entered Mobile on April 12, 1865.[P3]In 1879 the municipality went bankrupt, but the economy gradually improved. Banana importing commenced in the late 1800s, supplementing the old export trade in lumber and cotton that were produced inland. The port’s commerce was progressively stimulated by the opening of the Panama Canal (1914), the completion of a system of locks and dams on the Black Warrior and Tombigbee rivers (1915), the development of the Intracoastal Waterway, the construction of the Alabama State Docks (begun in 1923), the completion of Cochrane Bridge across Mobile Bay (1927), the construction of Bankhead Tunnel under the Mobile River (1941), and the opening of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway (1985). Controlling the depth of the ship channel has been a vital factor in the commercial history of the city; the original minimum depth and width have gradually been greatly increased.[P4]Industrialization increased after 1900. Mobile played a major role as a port and shipbuilding and repair centre during World Wars I and II. It remains a centre for shipping and shipbuilding and repair. Natural gas from the gulf has become a major part of the economy; oil is also important. Major manufactures include paper products, chemicals, apparel, aircraft parts, and computer hardware and software. Education, health care, and government are the primary service industries. The city is the site of Spring Hill College (1830; Roman Catholic), the University of South Alabama (1963), the University of Mobile (1961; Baptist), and Bishop State Community College (1965).[P5]Bellingrath Gardens and Home is noted for its varieties of azaleas and other plants. Other points of interest include Oakleigh, an antebellum home; the USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park; Forts Morgan and Gaines; the Mobile Museum of Art; and the Museum of Mobile, with exhibits on local history. Historic Blakely State Park, site of the Civil War battle, and Meaher State Park are across the bay in Spanish Fort. Mobile is the birthplace of Mardi Gras in North America and celebrates it with parades and festivities each year. Other annual events include a historic homes tour in March and the Azalea Trail in March and April. Pop.

Alabama"Montgomery"Capital"Montgomery county"located in the central part of the state"Montgomery, capital of the state of Alabama, U.S., and seat (1822) of Montgomery county, located in the central part of the state. The city lies near the point where the Alabama River is formed by the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers. It was originally the site of Native American villages and was visited by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1540. About 1717 the French built Fort Toulouse on the river a short distance north of the present site of Montgomery. The city was founded and chartered in 1819 with the consolidation of two settlements and named for General Richard Montgomery, who had been killed during the American Revolution. It was made the state capital in 1846. In February 1861, just before the start of the American Civil War, Montgomery became the first capital of the Confederacy, though the capital was moved to Richmond, Virginia, later that year. Montgomery was captured by Union troops in 1865.[P1]Montgomery, Ala.State capitol in Montgomery, Ala.Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty Images[ML1]After its recovery from the war, Montgomery developed as an important centre and market for cotton, livestock, yellow pine, and hardwood. Services, especially government and health care, now form a major part of the city’s economy. Livestock and dairying are also important. Industry includes poultry and beef processing and the manufacture of water heaters, wood products, plastics, textiles, and aircraft parts.[P2]The adjacent Maxwell Air Force Base and its Gunter Annex have added much to the civic and commercial life of the city. Maxwell is the headquarters of Air University. Montgomery itself is the seat of Auburn University Montgomery (1967), Troy University (1957), Faulkner University (1942), Huntingdon College (1854; Methodist), and Alabama State University (moved from Marion in 1887).[P3]The capitol building is where Alabama voted to secede from the Union on January 11, 1861, and the Confederate States of America was organized there on February 4, 1861. Other important buildings are the First White House of the Confederacy, where Jefferson Davis resided, and the Alabama Department of Archives and History, which contains a historical museum and genealogical facilities. Other attractions include the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts; the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum, dedicated to the author and his wife, who once lived in the city; and Old Alabama Town, a historical district depicting 19th-century Alabama life. Montgomery has a ballet company and a symphony orchestra. The Alabama Shakespeare Festival runs throughout most of the year. Just outside the city are Fort Toulouse/Jackson Park, a historical site featuring the reconstructed fort, and Jasmine Hill Gardens and Outdoor Museum, containing statues, fountains, and a variety of flowers.[P4]First White House of the Confederacy (1861), Montgomery, Ala.Karim Shamsi-Basha/Alabama Bureau of Tourism & Travel[ML4]Montgomery was the scene of important civil-rights activity in the late 1950s and the ’60s. Led by Martin Luther King, Jr., then a Montgomery minister, African Americans organized a peaceful boycott of the city’s public buses in December 1955 after Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white man; a year later segregation on buses was prohibited by court order. A drive to register black voters in 1965, centred at Selma, was countered with violence, which resulted in a protest march on Montgomery, led by King. The route of the march was designated the Selma-to-Montgomery National Historic Trail in 1996.

Opelika is a Creek word meaning “large swamp,” although there is no evidence of a swamp in the vicinity, and the name was probably meant to be descriptive of the river and lakes surrounding the area. The original settlement grew up around a Methodist church (1837). The arrival of the Montgomery and West Point Railroad in 1848 contributed to the early growth of the community, which developed as a commercial centre for the surrounding agricultural region. Manufacturing (textiles) followed in the early decades of the 20th century.[P2]Employment at nearby Auburn University is now the primary factor in the city’s economy. Textiles are still important, as are the manufacture of tires and magnetic tape. Chewacla State Park is just south of Auburn. The Museum of East Alabama contains exhibits on local culture.

Alaska"Anchorage"City""Anchorage was founded in 1914 as the headquarters of the Alaska Railroad running north to Fairbanks"Anchorage, city (municipality), south-central Alaska, U.S. Lying at the base of the Chugach Mountains, it is a port at the head of Cook Inlet (a bay of the Pacific Ocean).[P1]AnchorageAnchorage, Alaska, with the Chugach Mountains in the background.Frank Kovalchek[ML1]In 1835 Russians established a mission across the inlet from the area that constitutes the modern city of Anchorage. After gold was discovered in the late 19th century, the area’s population surged. Anchorage was founded in 1914 as the headquarters of the Alaska Railroad running north to Fairbanks. A railway link with Seward was finished in 1918, and five years later the entire Alaska Railroad was completed. In the 1930s, during the Dust Bowl drought that devastated agriculture in much of the central continental United States, settlers from the American Midwest were given federal assistance to move to the Anchorage area to develop an agricultural community. By the turn of the 21st century, this sector was declining. The city became a key aviation and defense centre with the construction of Fort Richardson and Elmendorf Air Force Base during World War II, and completion of the Alaska Highway during the war linked Anchorage with the continental United States. Subsequently Anchorage became a regular stop on air routes from Europe and the United States to East Asia. On March 27, 1964, a severe earthquake caused a number of deaths and extensive property damage in the city.[P2]Anchorage is Alaska’s most populous city and the state’s chief commercial centre. Its economy is based primarily on defense projects and the exploitation of natural resources, including oil. Tourism is also significant. The city is the seat of a campus of the University of Alaska (1954) and of Alaska Pacific University (chartered as Alaska Methodist University, 1957). The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, organized in 1967, commences in the city and ends in Nome. Far North Bicentennial Park features a ski area, miles of trails for hiking and mountain biking, and a wildlife area that features moose and bears. Chugach State Park and Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge are also popular recreational and wildlife-watching locations. Other notable attractions include the Anchorage Museum of History and Art (1968), the state’s largest museum; Alaska Heritage Library and Museum (1968), featuring native artifacts and art; and Alaska Zoo (1968). Anchorage is linked by highway to Seward and Soldotna (south) and Denali National Park and Preserve and Fairbanks (north). About 45 miles (70 km) south of the city is Portage Glacier. Inc. 1920. Pop.

Alaska"Cordova"City""southern Alaska"Cordova, city, southern Alaska, U.S. Situated at the base of Eyak Mountain on Prince William Sound in the Gulf of Alaska, it lies about 150 miles (240 km) southeast of Anchorage. Named for its harbour (originally Puerto Cordova [now Orca Inlet], explored by the Spaniards in 1792), it was founded in 1908 as a port for the Copper River and Northwestern Railroad, which served the Kennecott Copper Company mines (ceased operations 1938); the mines are now part of Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve. Oil, discovered in 1902, was also important to the city’s economy, but the oil field was destroyed in 1933. The city was damaged by a severe earthquake on March 27, 1964. Fishing, canning, and fur farming are now the economic mainstays, augmented by tourism. Ferry service to Valdez connects Cordova with the Alaskan highway system. Local events include the Cordova Iceworm Festival (February), featuring a parade and fireworks; the Copper River Delta Shorebird Festival (May), when some five million birds feed and rest in the city along their migratory path; and the Copper River Wild Salmon Festival (June; the nearby Copper River is a spawning ground for a highly valued, succulent, red-fleshed species of salmon). Million Dollar Bridge, a railway bridge built in 1908, was converted to vehicular use in 1958.

The city was founded in 1902 during a gold strike and was named for Indiana Senator (later U.S. Vice President) Charles Warren Fairbanks. It soon became Alaska’s largest city, though it has since been surpassed by Anchorage. During World War II, Fairbanks served as a stopping point for airplanes traveling to the Soviet Union as part of the lend-lease program.[P2]The city lies on the 800-mile (1,300-km) Trans-Alaska Pipeline, constructed in the 1970s, midway between the Prudhoe Bay fields (north) and the Valdez terminal (south). As the northern terminus of the Alaska and Richardson highways and the Alaska Railroad and as the southern terminus of the Steese and Elliott highways, Fairbanks is the main supply centre for the booming oil business; it was the construction headquarters for the pipeline. Mining, lumbering, and fur trading are important, as are tourism and servicing nearby Fort Wainwright (originally Ladd Army Air Field [1939–62]) and Eielson Air Force Base (1943).[P3]The city is the seat of the University of Alaska (1917; founded as Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines); the university includes the Geophysical Institute, an animal research station, and a cultural and natural history museum. The World Eskimo-Indian Olympics have been held annually in Fairbanks since 1961. Other annual events are the Golden Days Celebration (July), the 800-mile (1,300-km) Yukon Marathon (a small-boat race; June), the 1,000-mile (1,600-km) Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race (February), and the Open and Limited North American Championship sled dog races (March).

Alaska"Haines"City""southeastern Alaska"Haines, city, southeastern Alaska, U.S. Located at the northern end of North America’s longest fjord, it also lies at the northern end of the Alexander Archipelago on a peninsula between the Chilkoot and Chilkat rivers. Situated near the point where the Taiya Inlet meets the Chilkoot Inlet, Haines is south of Skagway (the former gold-rush centre at the head of the Lynn Canal), 90 miles (145 km) north-northwest of Juneau. Haines (with Skagway) is the terminus of the Inside Passage (Alaska Marine Highway) and is linked by road with the Alaska Highway 160 miles (255 km) north. Originally inhabited by Chilkat (Tlingit) Indians (who called the area Dei Shu, meaning “End of the Trail”), it became a North West Trading Company post in 1878. After the establishment of a mission there in 1881, the community was named to honour Francina Electra Haines of the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions. With the discovery of gold in 1899, it became a gold-rush supply centre; it also served as an outlet for the Porcupine mining district and as a frontier fort. A U.S. army installation (deactivated 1946) was built in Haines in 1904, the only such base in Alaska until World War II.[P1]HainesHaines, Alaska.Andrei Taranchenko[ML1]Fishing (particularly of halibut and salmon), timbering, and tourism are economic mainstays. Haines has acquired a reputation as a Chilkat Indian cultural centre, known particularly for carving and weaving crafts and for ceremonial dances; native culture is displayed at the Alaska Indian Arts centre. One of the area’s most popular attractions is the nearly 50,000-acre (20,000-hectare) Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve (1982), which contains the world’s largest concentration of bald eagles; a bald eagle festival is held annually in November. Haines hosts the annual Southeast Alaska State Fair.

Alaska"Homer"City""southern Alaska"Homer, city, southern Alaska, U.S. It lies on the Kenai Peninsula and the northern shore of Kachemak Bay, some 225 miles (360 km) south of Anchorage. The region was originally inhabited by Eskimos (Inuit) and then by Tanaina Indians. The city grew up around the coal mines that were established there in 1889. It was founded in 1895 and named (1896) for Homer Pennock, a gold prospector, though he left the area within a year. Mining had faded by the turn of the 20th century, replaced largely by fishing. Much of the city was damaged by a massive earthquake in 1964. Tourism and fishing (commercial and sport) are the main economic activities, and Homer brands itself the “Halibut Capital of the World.” The city is situated on the Sterling Highway connecting Seward and towns on the Cook Inlet area, and it serves as a trading centre for a vast farming region; it also still has large reserves of coal. Homer’s active artist community contributes to the local economy by selling crafts, sculptures, paintings, and pottery. The city is the seat of the Kachemak Bay campus of Kenai Peninsula College, an extended campus of the University of Alaska Anchorage. An annual shorebird festival (May), first held in 1993, celebrates the migratory gathering of some 100,000 birds. Another annual event is the Winter Carnival (February). Homer serves as a gateway to Kachemak Bay State Park and State Wilderness Park, a popular recreational area (boating, kayaking, fishing, and hiking) containing some 400,000 acres (160,000 hectares) of glaciers, forests, and mountains.

Alaska"Juneau"City""is located in the southeastern part of the state"Juneau, city and borough, capital (since 1906) of Alaska, U.S. The city, at the heart of the Inside Passage (Alaska Marine Highway), is located in the southeastern part of the state, on the Gastineau Channel. Sheltered from the Pacific Ocean by a belt of islands 75 miles (120 km) wide, it lies at the foot of Mounts Roberts (3,819 feet [1,164 metres]) and Juneau (3,576 feet [1,090 metres]).[P1]Juneau, AlaskaJuneau, Alaska, U.S.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML1]The area was originally inhabited by Tlingit Indians, who fished the salmon-rich waters of the channel. It was settled in 1880 when gold was discovered by Joe Juneau and Richard Harris. Large-scale mining replaced panning in short order. The city, which had been laid out in 1880, was formed in 1900, when it was named the territorial capital (the actual seat of government was moved from Sitka to Juneau in 1906). The first session of the territorial legislature was held in Juneau in 1913. In 1916 the Alaska-Juneau gold mine was built (ceased operations 1944), and gold was mined on Douglas Island until 1917, when a flood and cave-in caused the closure of Treadwell mine. In 1970 Juneau merged with Douglas (with which it is connected by a bridge erected in 1935), on the island across the channel, to form the largest city (in area) in the United States, covering 3,248 square miles (8,412 square km). The state’s oil boom precipitated a number of capital-improvement programs in the city in the 1970s and early 1980s.[P2]Juneau, AlaskaDowntown Juneau, Alaska, U.S.Ted McGrath[ML2]Government activities are central to Juneau’s economy, employing some two-fifths of the workforce. Fishing and forestry are also important, as is tourism, particularly because of cruise ships plying the Inside Passage. Juneau is connected with the Alaska Highway by ferry through the Haines Cut-Off. Winter snowfall seldom accumulates more than a foot, and the port is ice-free. Juneau is the seat of University of Alaska Southeast (1972) and home of the Alaska State Museum (1900), and it also contains the oldest Russian Orthodox church (built 1894) in southeastern Alaska. The Mount Roberts Tramway, which ascends some 2,000 feet (600 metres), provides riders with a picturesque view of the city and delivers them to a series of walkways and hiking trails. Douglas Island is a popular site for skiing, and other recreational activities include kayaking, dogsledding, whale watching, and hiking. Juneau lies within Tongass National Forest. Nearby are Mendenhall Glacier, part of the extensive Juneau Icefield, 13 miles (21 km) north; Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, which with Kluane National Park and Reserve (Yukon, Canada), Wrangell–St. Elias National Park and Preserve (Alaska, U.S.), and Tatshenshini-Alsek National Park (British Columbia, Canada) constitutes a World Heritage site, to the northwest; and Kootznoowoo Wilderness Area and Admiralty Island National Monument, featuring a large concentration of brown bears, to the south.

Bowe[ML1]The site was originally a fishing settlement for the Tongass and Cape Fox Tlingit Indians, who named a creek in the area Kitschk-hin, meaning “Thundering Wings of an Eagle.” In the 1880s a cannery was built, and the area became a supply centre for miners during the gold rush of the 1890s. The canning of fish (particularly salmon) subsequently became the city’s chief economic activity. Logging and lumbering also developed, especially during World War II, though Ketchikan’s pulp mill closed in 1997.[P2]The city now has a diversified economy, with fishing (salmon, trout, cod, halibut, and snapper), fish processing, and timber as leading industries. Tourism is also important, as the city is served by air transport and by cruise ships along the Inside Passage (Alaska Marine Highway). The city is centred on its waterfront, with many buildings constructed above the water on pilings. Its setting makes an ideal location for several annual fishing derbies. The Ketchikan campus of the University of Alaska Southeast was opened as a community college in 1954. Deer Mountain Hatchery, which releases tens of thousands of salmon annually, is a popular tourist site. Tongass Historical Museum features exhibits on the history of Ketchikan and southeastern Alaska.[P3]More than a sixth of the city’s population is Alaskan native or American Indian, and artifacts from these cultures can be seen in Ketchikan’s Totem Heritage Center, which displays a number of 19th-century totem poles gathered from uninhabited Tlingit and Haida villages in the area.

Founded in 1792 by Aleksandr Andreyevich Baranov, manager in America for the Northeastern Company (later the Russian-American Company), it was first known as Pavlovsk Gavan, or Paul’s Harbor, and was the first capital of Russian Alaska. It replaced Three Saints Bay in commercial importance when it was chosen as the headquarters of the Russian fur-trading companies because of its good harbour. The city suffered severe damage in 1912, when it was blanketed by ash from the eruption of Novarupta Volcano near Mount Katmai, and in 1964, when a series of tsunamis caused by a massive earthquake destroyed much of the city. Before World War II, its economy was based upon cattle raising and herring and salmon fishing. After the war, dairying and the harvesting of shellfish and king crabs also became important economically. It is now one of the largest fishing ports in the United States and has many fish-processing plants. Kodiak is the site of one of the few Russian Orthodox seminaries in the United States. Archaeological artifacts are housed in the Alutiiq Museum and Archaeological Repository (opened 1995). The city’s history is preserved in the Baranov Museum.

The area, which was a trading centre for a number of widely scattered Arctic villages, has long been inhabited by Inupiat Eskimos. The sound was named for the Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue, who searched for the Northwest Passage in 1815–18. Established as a reindeer station in 1897, the city was later the site of a U.S. Air Force base. It is now a regional service, shipping, transportation, and health centre for northwestern Alaska. Government services dominate the local economy, and tourism and seasonal fishing (chum salmon) are also important. Popular tourist sites include the NANA (Northwest Arctic Native Association) Museum of the Arctic (1976), which provides information about the native people of the area and is the largest museum in the world wholly dedicated to Eskimo culture, and North Tent City, a fishing camp where the catch is smoked and dried.

It is some 540 miles (870 km) northwest of Anchorage and 160 miles (260 km) east of the U.S.-Russian border. Before European contact the area had been inhabited solely by Eskimos. The discovery (September 1898) of gulch gold at nearby Anvil Creek resulted in a remarkable mining stampede. The miners’ camp, known as Anvil City, by 1900 had an estimated population of 20,000, though the population had decreased dramatically by 1903, as easily accessible claims were exhausted, and had dropped to 852 by 1920 (the decline was also accelerated by a devastating influenza outbreak in 1918). The settlement was soon renamed for Cape Nome, as given on a chart dated 1849 and said to be a British naval draftsman’s misinterpretation of the query “?Name.” Much of the city was destroyed by a fire in 1934. During World War II Nome was a way station for American-made planes being shipped to the Soviet Union as part of the lend-lease program. Gold mining remained the chief occupation until the dredge fields were closed in 1962. Transportation, tourism, fishing, reindeer herding, and Eskimo handicrafts are now the economic mainstays. Nome is served by airlines, freight steamers (in summer), and roads radiating into the tundra. The city’s Carrie M. McLain Memorial Museum features gold-rush-era artifacts and Eskimo art. Nome is also the destination city for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race (March), which begins in Anchorage; the path follows a route taken in the winter of 1925 when mushers raced serum from Anchorage to Nome to stop the spread of a diphtheria epidemic.

The area was long inhabited by Athabascan Indians. George Palmer established a trading post along the river about 1890, and in 1916 the town was established as a station on the Matanuska branch of the Alaska Railroad. In 1935, during the Great Depression, the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt established Palmer as the seat of the Alaska Rural Rehabilitation Corporation; it became a supply centre for some 200 farm families who were relocated to Alaska from northern Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Although many farms failed during the social experiment, Palmer survived as the sole Alaska city whose economy is dominated by farming. The city subsequently grew as a market for agricultural products of the Matanuska Valley. (The enormous cabbages and other summer produce nurtured in the “land of the midnight sun” come from this region.) Palmer also has some light manufacturing, and many of its residents commute to Anchorage for employment. It is the site of Matanuska-Susitna College (1958; originally Palmer Community College), a campus of the University of Alaska Anchorage. Palmer hosts the annual Alaska State Fair. The city lies adjacent to Chugach State Park (a popular recreation area for hiking, skiing, climbing, and many other activities), and Independence Mine State Historical Park (comprising two former gold mines) is just north of the city.

It was explored by a Russian expedition in 1741, and Old Sitka, or Fort St. Michael, was established in July 1799 by Aleksandr Baranov (Baranof), the first Russian governor of Alaska. The fort was destroyed by the Tlingit in 1802. The present city was founded as Novo Arkhangelsk (“New Archangel”) in 1804, when Baranov moved the headquarters of the Russian-American Company (a Russian trading company) there from Kodiak. After 1867 the settlement was commonly known as Sitka (derived from a Tlingit phrase meaning “on the outside of Shee [Baranof Island]”). The formal transfer of Alaska from Russia to the United States took place there on October 18, 1867, and Sitka served as the territorial capital until 1906, when the seat of government was moved to Juneau. The U.S. government built a naval air base there during World War II, which swelled the population to nearly 40,000. The base is now operated by the U.S. Coast Guard.[P2]Sitka’s principal economic activities are fishing, canning, lumbering, and tourism. The city is also a regional health-care centre. St. Michael’s Cathedral (Russian Orthodox, 1848) was the first Russian church built in North America; it was rebuilt after a fire destroyed it in 1966.

After it was severely damaged by the great Alaska earthquake of 1964, the city was rebuilt 5 miles (8 km) west on safer ground. Valdez was the principal settlement affected when the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989, in what was then the largest oil spill in U.S. history.[P1]ValdezHarbour at Valdez, Alaska.© Steve Bower/Shutterstock.com[ML1]It is a port of entry and the southern terminal for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline from Prudhoe Bay. The petroleum industry is the main economic activity, supplemented by mining, fish processing, and tourism. The city is the site of Prince William Sound Community College, a campus of the University of Alaska Anchorage. The Valdez Museum contains exhibits on the city’s history. Halibut- and salmon-fishing derbies are held during the summer. Valdez lies on a fjord at the base of the Chugach Mountains and is a gateway to Chugach National Forest.

Arizona"Ajo"Town"Pima county"southwestern Arizona"Ajo, town, Pima county, southwestern Arizona, U.S. Spaniards mined in the area in the 1750s, and the Ajo Copper Company (1854) was the first incorporated mining concern in the Arizona Territory. Copper and silver were the most valuable minerals mined in the area. The mines remained dormant from roughly 1860 until the 1900s when a townsite was laid out and a railroad built to Gila Bend, 40 miles (64 km) north. The community, originally named Muy Vavi (Papago: “Warm Water”), was renamed Ajo (Spanish: “Garlic”), for the wild garlic found in the surrounding hills. An alternative derivation claims the Papago word au’auho, meaning “paint,” as the origin of the town’s name, for the red paint pigment found there and used by the Papago.[P1]Ajo: former train stationFormer train station in Ajo, Arizona.© PHB.cz/Fotolia[ML1]Ajo’s economy virtually depends on the Phelps Dodge Corporation, which operates the New Cornelia Open Pit Mine (390 acres [158 hectares]) and a smelter plant. A strike in 1985 led Phelps Dodge to suspend production, and depressed worldwide copper prices throughout the 1990s stymied efforts to reopen the mine. Nearby are the Papago Indian Reservation (east), the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge (west), and the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument (south).

It is built on steep canyon slopes (east of the Mule Mountains) and was for many years a major copper-producing centre; area mines also produced large quantities of malachite, aurichalcite, and other minerals. The city began as a prospectors’ camp after the discovery of copper in 1877, and it was established in 1880 and named for Judge DeWitt Bisbee, part owner of the Phelps Dodge and Company’s Copper Queen Mine. In its heyday, Bisbee was the largest city between Houston, Texas, and Los Angeles, California. During World War I, more than 1,000 striking miners led by Industrial Workers of the World organizers were forcibly transported to Columbus, New Mexico, in an event known as the Bisbee Deportation of 1917.

The Gila River makes a sweeping 90° bend westward at this point, hence the name. The city is near a pre-Columbian Hohokam village first visited in 1699 by Father Eusebio Kino. It had been a rancheria abandoned by Indians the Spanish called Opas, who had annually produced two crops of grain. The rancheria was re-established in 1774 by Juan Bautista de Anza and Father Francisco Garcés, who called it Santos Apóstoles San Simón y Judas. A colony of white men began a settlement in 1865 at the site of the old rancheria, and the settlement came to be known as Gila Bend. The town location later shifted because a railroad in 1880 laid track away from the river bank. The river itself changed course, passing to the north of the town. Today an agricultural town and service centre for travelers passing through on Interstate 8, Gila Bend relies on water stored at Gillespie Dam for irrigating its fields.

The Salt River valley, popularly called the Valley of the Sun, includes not only Phoenix but also nearby cities such as Mesa, Scottsdale, and Tempe. Phoenix plays a prominent role in the economy of the Mountain West region of the country, serving as a financial, communications, and transportation hub. Area 450 square miles (1,165 square km). Pop.

Like its California counterpart, Phoenix is a metropolis with not one but many centres, all at considerable distances from one another. From its historic heart to the west of Sky Harbor International Airport, the greater metropolitan area—of which Phoenix is only a small part—has grown to take in a vast expanse of land that stretches nearly from the Gila River far to the south to the tall plateaus and volcanic mountains of the north and east and out into the broad desert valley to the west. Growth is a constant in Phoenix life as thousands of new residents and millions of visitors find their way there each year.[P2] [H3]Landscape City site Phoenix lies near the confluence of the Gila and Salt rivers and is situated at the extreme northern part of the Sonoran Desert, an arid ecological zone whose characteristic plant is the nationally protected saguaro cactus. To the east of Phoenix are the rugged Superstition Mountains, a large complex of volcanic calderas that formed about 305 million years ago; the mountains reach to about 3,000 feet (900 metres) at their highest point. The Mazatzal Mountains rise to the northeast; the Verde River flows to the west of the mountains, entering the Salt River east of Phoenix.[P3]Phoenix, ArizonaPhoenix, Arizona, and the surrounding desert.David Kadlubowski/Corbis[ML3] The broad valley in which the city lies extends west to the Colorado River and south to the mountain chains north of Tucson, although the geographic borders of Phoenix end far short of those natural barriers. The Phoenix metropolitan area—the Valley of the Sun—stands at an elevation of 1,100 feet (335 metres) above sea level. The northern and eastern ends of this valley rise into the surrounding volcanic peaks; the remainder is level terrain, dotted with small volcanic mountains of granite and schist. Camelback Mountain, Squaw Peak, and South Mountain are the most prominent of these urban peaks, reaching elevations of about 2,600 to 2,700 feet (790 to 820 metres).[P4] The desert soil is alkaline, and the water in the river and in local wells is saline and contains other minerals. Many irrigated areas in the Phoenix area are encrusted with dried mineral deposits, which accumulate and reduce the productivity of the soil. Water is strangely abundant, given the fact that the city lies in one of the most arid regions on the continent; the valley overlies a subterranean sedimentary bowl that can hold vast quantities of groundwater. However, these stores have been substantially depleted, and Phoenix increasingly has come to depend on water from the Colorado River via the Central Arizona Project (CAP), an artificial waterway 336 miles (541 km) long extending from Lake Havasu on the California border to Tucson. In addition, water from subterranean stores is piped into the valley from outlying areas. In the past, virtually all of the region’s water was used for agricultural purposes, although an increasing share is now apportioned for municipal use.[P5] Climate Phoenix has a dry, warm climate that in the winter months attracts tens of thousands of visitors. The average daily high temperature in the winter approaches 70 °F (21 °C), but summer highs typically rise to more than 100 °F (38 °C). It is almost always sunny throughout the year.[P6] Precipitation averages less than 8 inches (200 mm) annually, divided almost evenly between the winter and summer months. In summertime, the so-called monsoon season, much of this precipitation returns to the atmosphere almost immediately through evaporation or transpiration.[P7] None of the mountains ringing Phoenix to the north and east reaches an elevation high enough to attract much moisture. The city depends almost wholly on groundwater that flows from the Salt and Gila rivers, as well as supplemental water brought in by aqueducts via the CAP.[P8] City layout Until relatively recently, some three-fifths of the land within the Phoenix city limits was undeveloped. In the mid-1970s a plan was proposed to develop these vacant lands through a program of “infill” construction, taking advantage of the infrastructure that was already in place. Instead, however, the city pursued a policy of annexing surrounding communities, expanding outward to accommodate its growing population.[P9] Phoenix has grown to absorb many satellite communities, and it is surrounded by other independent municipalities that have boomed on their own. These include Scottsdale, an affluent area known for its shopping and art districts, to the northeast; Fountain Hills, an exclusive community in the hills east of Scottsdale; Tempe, a middle-class suburb that is home to Arizona State University, to the east and Mesa, the “Mormon capital of Arizona,” farther east; Chandler, where a high-technology centre has emerged, to the southeast; the once-small agricultural communities of Gilbert and Queen Creek east of Chandler; Glendale, Goodyear, and Avondale to the west; and Sun City, one of the first retirement communities in the country, to the northwest.[P10] [H4]People The population of Phoenix is predominantly white (i.e., generally of European ancestry); the site was settled largely by Midwesterners in several waves of migration. More than two-fifths of the people identify themselves as Hispanic. A large proportion of the city’s Hispanic population is from Mexico, and Hispanics constitute a significant segment of the unskilled labour force. Other minorities in the city are Asians, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders.[P11] The Hohokam were the earliest permanent Native American inhabitants of the Phoenix area. After them came the Akimel O’odham (Pima), Maricopa, Yavapai, and Yaqui groups. The U.S. government sent many of these peoples to nearby reservations in the 19th century. Although only a fraction of the city’s population is Native American, Phoenix still has one of the largest urban concentrations of Native Americans in the country. Several reservations are located to the south and northeast of the metropolitan area.[P12] African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans live primarily in the southern portion of the city, below the downtown district. Open ethnic conflict is rare, except as it is played out by rival gangs of mostly young inner-city residents.[P13] Despite the large number of retirement communities in the area, the overwhelming majority of the population is under the age of 45. The majority of the people also tend to be relatively new to the region, many residents having lived in Phoenix for less than a decade.[P14] [H5]Economy Phoenix’s economy was once dominated by ranching and farming, but it shifted in the mid-20th century to one based on services, technology, and, more notably, tourism. Maricopa county was one of the top urban agricultural producers in the country in 1980, but farming has since steadily lost ground to urban growth; now only a small portion of the labour force is engaged in food production.[P15] About three-fourths of the state’s manufacturing jobs are located in the Phoenix area. Light industry is predominant, especially the manufacture of electronics, transportation equipment, aerospace technology, foodstuffs, and cosmetics. The principal crops are cotton, durum wheat, fruits, and vegetables. Only a small proportion of the workforce in the private sector belongs to labour unions, which, along with tax incentives, has made Phoenix attractive to relocating corporations, many of them engaged in the manufacture of semiconductors and other electronic components. The region has thus emerged as a centre of high-technology production. A well-developed electronics infrastructure also has made Phoenix a capital of the telecommunications industry. More than half the labour force works in banking, finance, and other service activities. For the most part, however, the city’s economy still depends on tourism, especially in the winter months.[P16] Phoenix is well served by roads, railways, and airlines. Automobiles are the most popular method of transportation, which has led to severe air pollution. All streets within the city limits were paved by 1920, far ahead of many metropolitan areas in the country. Phoenix is served by a system of freeways, most of which were built in the last two decades of the 20th century to alleviate congestion. Construction of a light-rail system began in 2006. A branch line of the Union Pacific Railroad connects the city to the main line between Los Angeles and El Paso. Regular airline connections to Phoenix began in the late 1920s. Several airports serve the metropolitan area; the most important of these is Sky Harbor International, southeast of downtown.[P17]Phoenix, Arizona: freewayFreeway in Phoenix, Arizona.© Andrew Zarivny/Shutterstock.comPhoenix, Arizona: light-rail trainLight-rail train in Phoenix, Arizona.© You Touch Pix of EuToch/Shutterstock.com[ML17] [H6]Administration and society Government Phoenix has operated on a council-manager system since 1914; it was one of the first cities in the country to adopt this now-common method of governance. Until the late 1940s, powers were evenly divided between the two entities, with council members able to reward political patronage. Vulnerable to corruption, this system ended when the Charter Government Committee—led by department store executive and later Republican Party presidential nominee Barry M. Goldwater, who became a member of the city council in 1949—implemented several key organizational reforms.[P18] By the late 1990s, Phoenix had developed a business-oriented city government headed by a city manager appointed by the city council. The council, made up of eight elected members, sets city policy, enacts ordinances, and appropriates funds for long-term city projects. The mayor, elected at large, serves as the head of the council for a four-year term. Individual members are elected by district; they initially serve two-year terms and can be reelected to serve subsequent four-year terms.[P19] Municipal services Phoenix, in concert with the Maricopa Association of Governments and the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, provides a range of services for its citizens. The city has an extensive network of public parks, notably Encanto and Papago parks and the Phoenix Mountains Preserve, a 6,000-acre (2,400-hectare) natural park in a desert-foothills setting. The 17,000-acre (6,900-hectare) South Mountain Park, one of the largest city parks in the country, lies on the south side of the city.[P20] Health The system of health care in the Phoenix area has experienced severe setbacks, especially since the 1980s. Managed-care corporations have assumed control of most medical facilities and imposed cutbacks on services. Residents may receive care at the area’s public hospital, the Maricopa County Medical Center. The Arizona State Hospital provides inpatient mental health care. The Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale (opened 1987) includes medical research facilities.[P21] Education Until the mid-1980s the educational system was characterized by inadequate funding, overcrowding, and poorly trained staff. In later years additional funding, stricter requirements, and the development of specialized magnet schools yielded some positive results, with students scoring well above national averages on several standardized tests.[P22] Several public and private institutions of higher learning are located in and around Phoenix. Arizona State University (1885), a state land-grant institution, has three campuses in the Phoenix-Tempe area. Other institutions include the University of Phoenix (1976), Grand Canyon University (1949), Southwestern College (1960), Western International University (1978), and Thunderbird, the Garvin School of International Management (1946), in Glendale. The Maricopa Community College District is one of the largest community college systems in the country.[P23]Phoenix, Arizona: Grand Canyon University ArenaGrand Canyon University Arena, Phoenix, Arizona.Grand Canyon University[ML23] [H7]Cultural life In the late 1940s several organizations, including the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra and the Phoenix Art Museum, introduced a notable program of visiting artists and touring exhibits. Today the area is home to several fine art facilities, with the flagship Phoenix Art Museum holding a collection of more than 13,000 pieces, including a major collection of Southwestern art. The Heard Museum houses more than 75,000 Southwestern Native American works of art. The Arizona Science Center, a complex including exhibit halls, a planetarium, and a big-screen cinema, opened in 1997. The Pueblo Grande archaeological museum studies and preserves the ruins of the area’s most prominent settlement of the Hohokam people.[P24]Phoenix, Arizona: Rosson House MuseumRosson House Museum in Phoenix, Arizona.Richard T. Nowitz/Corbis[ML24] In Papago Park are the Phoenix Desert Botanical Garden, which has a collection of some 20,000 desert plants, and the 125-acre (51-hectare) Phoenix Zoo, which opened in 1962. Founded by appliance magnate Robert E. Maytag, the zoo is the largest privately owned nonprofit zoo in the country, although it receives some funding and support from the city. It participates in scientific research on the ecology of the Sonoran Desert, breeding programs for endangered and threatened species, and other ventures and has a highly regarded program of education and public outreach.[P25]Phoenix, Arizona: Desert Botanical GardenDesert Botanical Garden in Papago Park, Phoenix, Arizona.Jan Butchofsky-Houser/Corbis[ML25] Since the late 1980s, civic leaders have approved several costly improvements to the area’s downtown arts and museum district, which includes the city’s convention centre, one of the largest municipally operated facilities of its kind in the country. Originally constructed in the early 1970s, it has undergone subsequent renovation and adjoins a complex of museums, performing arts venues, and sports facilities, including a baseball stadium and a basketball arena.[P26] Sports have a central role in the cultural life of Phoenix. Baseball is particularly popular. The local professional team is the Arizona Diamondbacks, and many other Major League Baseball teams hold their spring training camps (known as the Cactus League) in areas surrounding the city; several others train in the Tucson area. The area’s other professional sports teams include the Cardinals (gridiron football), the Suns (men’s basketball), the Mercury (women’s basketball), and the Coyotes (ice hockey). There are also tracks for automobile, horse, and dog racing. Tennis and golf are widely played, and running, walking, and biking along the banks of the CAP aqueducts are popular recreational activities.[P27] The metropolitan area’s chief daily newspaper is the Arizona Republic. The Phoenix New Times is a weekly covering arts, culture, and politics. The Business Journal Phoenix, a weekly, provides economic and financial news.[P28] Nearby Scottsdale is the site of Taliesin West, the Arizona home and studio of architect Frank Lloyd Wright and the winter campus for the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture. Scottsdale is also the site of the Cosanti Foundation, founded by the Italian architect and builder Paolo Soleri. Located in Tempe is Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium, a theatre designed by Wright that has a 2,900-pipe organ. Tonto National Monument is about 60 miles (95 km) east and Casa Grande National Monument some 50 miles (80 km) south of Phoenix.[P29]Taliesin WestTaliesin West, near Scottsdale, Ariz.Larry Pieniazek[ML29] [H8]History The early period Archaeological excavations in the mid-20th century by Emil W. Haury at Ventana Cave, southwest of Phoenix, uncovered human and animal remains and stone tools dating to about 10,000 years ago. Possibly as early as 300 bc, the Hohokam people arrived in the area and remained until about ad 1400. A farming people, the Hohokam developed an elaborate system of irrigation canals extending far from the banks of the Salt River. Hohokam culture collapsed in the 15th century for reasons that are not entirely known. The Akimel O’odham (Pima) were the successors to the Hohokam in the Phoenix area.[P30] European arrivals Spanish explorers arrived in what is now Arizona in the 16th century. A chain of missions and small forts extending northward from Mexico along the Santa Cruz River valley was established by 1700. In that period the Spanish made contact with the Akimel O’odham and Maricopa Indians, whose settlements along the Salt and Gila rivers were in close proximity to the northernmost mission.[P31] In 1846, following the outbreak of the Mexican-American War, a detachment of Mormon volunteers entered the region and made its way to the villages of the Akimel O’odham. There they traded goods for fresh produce and grains. After the war, some of the Mormons returned to the area, established small farms along the Gila and Salt rivers, and founded the towns of Mesa, Florence, and Safford.[P32] The Mormons gave the name Pumpkinville to what is now Phoenix. In 1867 Jack Swilling, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War, began a grain-milling business near the site of the present Sky Harbor International Airport to provision the federal garrison at Camp McDowell. Two years before Swilling’s arrival, a local farmer named John Y.T. Smith, the first person of European descent to settle in the Salt River valley, had planted grain in the area. The renaming of the town was left to an Englishman and early town civic leader, Darrell Duppa. He chose the name Phoenix, giving the explanation, “A new city will spring phoenix-like upon the ruins of a former civilization.”[P33] From a town to a city Pioneers came to the valley in increasing numbers throughout the late 1860s, and on October 20, 1870, Phoenix was officially established as a town. A county building and the area’s first schoolhouse were completed in September 1872. A telegraph line, operated by the pioneer prospector and merchant Morris Goldwater, was established in 1874, and a national bank opened in 1878.[P34] After Phoenix became a city in 1881, civic leaders began to lobby for the construction of a railroad. In July 1887 a secondary line of the Southern Pacific Railroad (now Union Pacific Railroad) connected Phoenix to the main line leading east to El Paso and west to Los Angeles, providing a large and accessible market for the valley. With increased prosperity, the city began to modernize. Having already opened one of the first electric-power generating plants in the West in 1886, the city installed a streetcar system that soon traversed much of the valley. Within a few years Phoenix also had a hospital, a public library, and other municipal facilities.[P35] Those leaders also worked to bring the Arizona territorial capital to Phoenix. Since the establishment of the territory in 1864, the legislature had relocated from Prescott to Tucson, then back to Prescott again. After extensive lobbying on the part of the city’s emerging business elite, the legislature moved to Phoenix in 1889. A local farmer donated a 10-acre (4-hectare) site for the territorial capitol, and the new building was dedicated on February 25, 1901. When Arizona attained statehood on February 14, 1912, the building became the state capitol.[P36] The boomtown years In the first years of the 20th century the people of Phoenix recognized that the region’s potential was limited by its unreliable water supply. They formed the Salt River Valley Water Users’ Association to lobby for the creation of a large-scale project to control the flow of the river and harness its water for irrigation. The National Reclamation Act of 1902 had made government funding available for such public works. In 1905 construction began on the Roosevelt Dam, the first such structure on the Salt River; it was finished in 1911, making it possible to irrigate the surrounding desert and thus use it as farmland. In following years three more dams were added on the Salt and two on the Verde River.[P37] With a network of reservoirs in place, Phoenix grew as an important agricultural centre in the early 20th century, providing winter vegetables and grain for much of the West. During World War I many of the city’s farms shifted to the production of Egyptian (pima) cotton, which was needed for use in clothing, tires, airplane fabrics, and munitions. Russian, Japanese, and Mexican migrant workers traveled to Phoenix to work in the cotton fields, and by the 1920s the city underwent a cotton boom. A decade later the Great Depression put an end to such prosperity. Facing that unexpected downturn in the agricultural economy, Phoenix’s business community—led by Dwight Heard, John Orme, William Murphy, and other prominent citizens—worked to diversify the city’s economy, especially by encouraging the development of tourism.[P38] During World War II Arizona’s deserts served as military bases. Many of the soldiers who passed through Arizona liked what they saw and returned at the end of the war. Several hundred German and Italian prisoners of war who had been interned in camps in and near Phoenix chose to remain rather than return to their homelands after 1945.[P39] Postwar growth The population grew substantially in the decade following the war, as affordable home air-conditioning became available. During that time hundreds of manufacturing firms relocated from other parts of the country. By 1960 half of the state’s population lived in the Phoenix area.[P40]Downtown Phoenix, Ariz.Adalberto Rios Lanz/Sexto Sol/Getty Images[ML40] Another factor in Phoenix’s growth was the arrival of another source of water. Arizona Senators Carl Hayden and Barry Goldwater lobbied for a massive public works project, and in 1968 the Colorado River Basin Project Act was passed. The act authorized the CAP, which involved constructing a series of dams along with a canal that would divert water from the Colorado River to be used by many communities, including Phoenix and Tucson.[P41] The military presence in the Phoenix area also contributed to the city’s rapid growth. Until the 1930s, Camp McDowell was the sole military outpost in the region; in the years preceding World War II, however, Phoenix’s business elite, led by Goodyear Tire chairman Frank Littlefield, successfully lobbied for the relocation of several U.S. Army Air Corps detachments to the area. Two important air bases, Williams and Luke, were established, and the military brought in thousands of personnel, many of whom remained or returned after completion of their service. In the aftermath of the Cold War, the military presence was reduced somewhat, but the U.S. Air Force has continued to figure prominently in the local economy and be an important employer of civilians.[P42] Corruption and conflict In the late 1960s and early ’70s corruption was an impediment to convincing nonmilitary employers to move into the Phoenix area. Bruce Babbitt, who in the mid-1970s was the state attorney general, warned that not only the Phoenix area but the entire state had earned reputations beyond their borders as dens of vice and crime. Land fraud was common, as was the illegal use of undocumented workers—mostly from Mexico and Central America—in factories and farms at extremely low pay rates. In 1976 Arizona Republic reporter Don Bolles was murdered while investigating the connections between organized crime and agriculture and banking within Arizona; public outcry brought on several criminal conspiracy trials and the imprisonment of such crime figures as Ned Warren, locally known as the “Godfather of land fraud.” The spectre of corruption emerged again in the late 1980s, when Phoenix financier and developer Charles Keating was convicted on the charge of having stolen more than $1 billion from a financial firm that he controlled. The institution’s demise was one of the largest bank failures in the country’s history.[P43] Into the 21st century With increased prosperity in the 1990s, many of the city’s social ills, notably crime, lessened, and material conditions improved. In 1993 the CAP, construction of which began in the early 1970s, was officially completed. The city continued to grow through policies of annexation and promotion to bring businesses to the area. By the early 21st century Phoenix and the once-distinct cities that surround it had emerged as one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country in terms of both area and population.[P44] Gregory Lewis McNamee [END-OF-CONTENT]

(An alternative account holds that the townsite was named for the granite rocks of the nearby Dragoon Mountains, which stand out against the landscape like tombstones.) By 1881 a silver rush had set in, bringing an estimated 7,000 people to the area. Along with the prospectors came adventurers and outlaws, among whom were Wyatt Earp, John H. “Doc” Holliday, and Johnny Ringo, whereupon Tombstone gained a reputation for lawlessness. Feuds were common, the most notable being the gun battle at the O.K. Corral in 1881 between the Earp and Clanton families. The boom days quickly ended in 1911 with floodwaters in the mines, labour strikes, and low silver prices. Tombstone was the county seat from 1881 to 1931.

On August 20, 1775, the small walled pueblo of Tucson was made a presidio (fort) of the Spanish army, and when Spanish rule was superseded by that of Mexico, the walled town remained the military headquarters of the province. The “Old Pueblo” has lived under four flags (Spanish, Mexican, Confederate, and U.S.).[P2]Tucson lay in the territory that was acquired from Mexico by the United States in the Gadsden Purchase (1854), and the town served as the territorial capital of Arizona from 1867 to 1877. Its growth was further stimulated by the arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad (1880), the discovery of silver at nearby Tombstone and copper at Bisbee, and irrigation developments. Since World War II the city has experienced remarkable growth, partly due to the annexation of suburbs.

Laid out in 1880 by Henry T. Blythe, a Methodist minister, it initially had a lumber-oriented economy. After intensive logging had cleared the county’s cypress and hardwood forests, the region was developed for agriculture and the processing of agricultural products. Blytheville annexed Chickasawba in 1907 and developed as the service centre for a productive cotton-growing area; soybeans, rice, and wheat are also grown there.[P1]The population increased after 1962, when Blytheville Air Force Base (renamed Eaker Air Force Base in 1988) was included within the city limits.

A second fort was established on the site in 1838 (construction being completed in 1846) and played a significant role during the forced removal of Cherokee and other Native Americans to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) via the Trail of Tears. It was commanded by General Zachary Taylor, later 12th president of the United States, in the early 1840s.

Hot Springs National Park is intertwined with the northern portion of the city.[P1]Hot SpringsHot Springs, Ark.© Caitlin Mirra/Shutterstock.com[ML1]The area is noted for its numerous thermal springs, which were long used by Native Americans and probably were visited by the Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto in 1541. French fur trappers and traders frequented the springs from the late 17th century, and the area was mapped in 1804 by an expedition led by the Americans William Dunbar and George Hunter. Permanent settlement of the site dates from 1807.[P2]Hot Springs National Park originated in 1832 as Hot Springs Reservation on land set aside by the federal government. Later enlarged, it became a national park in 1921 and today covers 9 square miles (23 square km). Central to the park are the 47 hot springs and 8 historic bathhouses along Central Avenue (also called Bathhouse Row) located on the southwestern slope of Hot Springs Mountain. Water from the hot springs flows at a rate of 850,000 gallons (3,200,000 litres) per day, with an average temperature of 143 °F (62 °C). Originally each of the bathhouses along Bathhouse Row had its own spring, but today the water is collected for common distribution to the restored Buckstaff Bathhouse (the one remaining active bathhouse along the row), four hotel bathhouses, and several medical facilities. The Fordyce Bathhouse, also located along Bathhouse Row, has been restored to look as it did between 1915 and 1920; it is the park’s visitor centre. The exteriors of the other six historic bathhouses also have been restored. The surrounding Zig Zag Mountains that make up the park area beyond Bathhouse Row are heavily forested in oak, hickory, and pine, with stands of dogwood, redbud, and other flowering species. Wildlife is abundant and consists primarily of small mammals and numerous species of birds.[P3]The town of Hot Springs was incorporated in 1876 and became a city in 1886. Its population grew with the rise in popularity of the springs. Among the numerous hotels and bathhouses that sprang up in the area were those built outside the federal park, and in the 1920s and ’30s many of these were frequented by such gangsters as Al Capone and George (“Bugs”) Moran.

In 1722 Bernard de la Harpe, a French explorer, saw on the bank of the Arkansas River two conspicuous rock formations, which he reputedly named La Petite Roche and La Grande Roche. Near the smaller rock was a Quapaw Indian settlement, which La Harpe made his trading post. The “little rock” later became the abutment for a railway bridge. The “big rock,” 2 miles (3 km) further upstream, was the site of an army post and later a veterans hospital.[P1]The State Capitol, Little Rock, Ark.© csfotoimages/iStock.comLittle Rock, Ark.Little Rock, Ark.Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty Images[ML1]In 1812 William Lewis, a trapper, built his home at the “little rock.” In 1819 Arkansas became a territory, with its capital at Arkansas Post. The site of Little Rock was surveyed in 1820, and the territorial capital was moved there the next year. The capitol building where the legislature met from 1821 to 1836 is preserved in the Territorial Capitol Restoration, along with a block of buildings of the period, including the Old State House (designed by Gideon Shyrock and the second of Little Rock’s three state capitols) and the first print shop of the Arkansas Gazette, which merged in 1991 with the Arkansas Democrat to form the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Little Rock was strongly anti-Union at the outbreak of the American Civil War, and the Federal arsenal was seized by state authorities in 1861. In September 1863 Federal troops under General Frederick Steele occupied the city and established a pro-Union government.[P2]With the expansion of the railways in the 1880s, Little Rock became an important transportation centre. Industry in the metropolitan area experienced planned, diversified growth beginning in the 1940s, mainly because of the proximity of raw materials (timber, oil, gas, coal, and bauxite). The city became a river port in 1969 with the opening of a system of locks and dams on the Arkansas River. Large railroad shops are located across the river at North Little Rock. Little Rock is the chief market for the surrounding agricultural region.[P3]In 1957 the city became the focus of world attention over the right of nine black students to attend Central High School under a gradual desegregation plan adopted by the city school board in accordance with the 1954 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court holding racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional. The result was a test of power between the federal and state governments. Governor Orval E. Faubus ordered the state militia to prevent blacks from entering the school, but the state was enjoined from interfering by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who sent federal troops to the city to maintain order. Within the next decade, desegregation was accomplished in all public schools. In 1998 President William J. Clinton signed legislation designating Central High School a national historic site and awarded each of the “Little Rock Nine” the Congressional Gold Medal.[P4]Little Rock’s economy is based on government and financial services, food processing, and the manufacture of such items as cosmetics, telecommunications equipment, and data-transmission equipment.[P5]The city’s educational institutions include the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (1927; formerly Little Rock University), Philander Smith College (1877), the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (1879), Arkansas Baptist College (1884), and the state schools for the blind and the deaf.

The site was originally a peninsula that was part of Rancho San Antonio. Long the home of the Ohlone Indians, the locality was settled by the Spanish in the 1850s, and its name, which in Spanish means “grove of poplar trees,” was chosen by referendum in 1853. Alameda’s growth was stimulated by a ferry service to San Francisco, the building of railroad bridges and terminals, and the establishment of one of the first municipally operated electrical-power plants in the United States. The Tidal Canal (1902) changed Alameda to an island with an industrialized waterfront dominated by shipbuilding, steel fabrication, and lumber milling. Port facilities attracted fishing and cargo vessels, and in 1940 it became the site of a large naval air station (now closed). The city is also home to many high-technology companies, earning it the nickname “Silicon Island.” Alameda was among the first communities in California to choose the council-manager form of government, which was adopted later by most California cities.

Its name is German, meaning “Home on the (Santa) Ana (River).” Grapes grown for wine were initially important, but, after disease decimated the vineyards, many of them were replaced with citrus groves. Other agricultural products included chili peppers and walnuts. Railroads soon linked the growers to eastern markets, which spurred the city’s growth. After 1950 the community’s citrus groves all but disappeared as a result of the Los Angeles–Orange county urban-industrial expansion. The opening in 1955 of Disneyland amusement park, one of the country’s most popular tourist destinations, stimulated economic development in the city; Disney’s California Adventure opened in Anaheim in 2001. The Anaheim Convention Center is also a significant economic asset. In the 1960s the city developed major aerospace facilities.[P2]Anaheim is home to two professional sports franchises, the Angels of Major League Baseball and the Ducks of the National Hockey League.

Bakersfield was an agricultural trade centre for the mines of the Sierra Nevada and the Owens Valley in the 1870s. The Southern Pacific Railroad reached Sumner (now East Bakersfield), several miles northeast of downtown Bakersfield, in 1874 (it had bypassed the city of Bakersfield because of a right-of-way dispute between city and railroad officials), and the Santa Fe Railway was linked to Bakersfield in 1898. San Francisco capitalists, acquiring large-scale landholdings in the area, helped develop an extensive irrigation system to distribute the waters of the Kern River; the region subsequently became important in the production of grain, alfalfa, and livestock. The discovery of the Kern River oil fields in 1899 brought a large-scale petroleum industry, which was centred at Bakersfield.[P1]California State University, BakersfieldWalter Stiern Library, California State University, Bakersfield, Calif.Eixo[ML1]The city quickly rebuilt after a fire destroyed the business section in 1889 and again after an earthquake caused widespread damage in 1952.

Once the territory of the Kumeyaay Indians, the area now known as Chula Vista was claimed by the Spanish, the Mexicans, and then, with California’s statehood (1850), the Americans. The city was laid out in 1888 by the Santa Fe Railway and named for its “pretty view.” The completion of the Sweetwater Dam brought water to the city and spurred its development as a citrus centre; it was, for a period, the world’s leading grower of lemons, but freezing weather and drought in the 1910s harmed production. The city later turned to truck gardening, with celery as a principal crop.

First inhabited by Ohlone Indians, the site became a Spanish land grant (largely uninhabited) in the 18th century. Later a farming community known as Vista Grande, it resisted development until 1906, when an earthquake and subsequent fire drove people from San Francisco. After the quake John D. Daly, a dairyman who had moved to the area in the 1850s, opened his extensive farmlands, providing assistance to refugees from the disaster. Renamed Daly City in 1911, it absorbed the town of Colma (known for its cemeteries after San Francisco banned burials at the beginning of the 20th century) in 1936 and annexed Westlake in 1948. Industrial and residential growth surged following the post-World War II urban expansion of the San Francisco Bay area.

The area became part of Rancho Los Nietos, a Spanish land grant to Manuel Nieto, in 1784, and, when Nieto’s lands were subdivided among his heirs, part of the Mexican Rancho Santa Gertrudes (1834). In 1859 the rancho was purchased by James P. McFarland and John G. Downey, an Irish immigrant who became governor of California (1860–62), and in 1873 the city was founded. Once the domain of cattle ranchers, the city’s rancho lands were subdivided into farms, and the region developed as an agricultural community, with crops that included grain, corn (maize), beans, mustard, and various fruits (particularly oranges). A railway link was completed in 1874, enabling greater access to markets for the city’s products, which also included poultry. Beginning in the 1920s, agriculture gave way to the aircraft industry, and the city’s oil industry also expanded. After World War II, light industry developed. Downey played a pivotal role in the U.S. space program by being the site for the building of Saturn V booster rockets and lunar-landing modules for the Apollo program; Downey aerospace workers also built five space shuttles (including the ill-fated Columbia and Challenger). The facilities were closed in the late 1990s. Retail businesses, service industries, and manufacturing are now the city’s economic mainstays.

The area was explored by Gaspar de Portolá in 1769 and was part of Rancho Los Nietos, a Spanish land grant made to Manuel Nieto in 1784. The modern city now occupies parts of Ranchos Los Alamitos, Las Bolsas, and Los Coyotes. Garden Grove was founded in 1874 by Alonzo Cook, and it developed as a small farming community until a railway link was completed in the early 20th century and the city began to grow. Two disasters struck in the first decades of the 20th century: a major flood covered the city in several feet of water in 1916, and an earthquake destroyed much of the older sections of the city in 1933. After World War II, when many servicemen who had been stationed in Orange county made southern California their home, Garden Grove became one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States. Among its leading industries are construction, services, aerospace, and biotechnology.[P1]Garden Grove: Crystal Cathedral Crystal Cathedral, Garden Grove, California.Photo Anke Meskens[ML1]The most popular local event is the city’s annual strawberry festival, held annually (since 1958) over the Memorial Day weekend.

 Los Angeles"Hollywood"City""Lying northwest of downtown Los Angeles"Hollywood, district within the city of Los Angeles, California, U.S., whose name is synonymous with the American film industry. Lying northwest of downtown Los Angeles, it is bounded by Hyperion Avenue and Riverside Drive (east), Beverly Boulevard (south), the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains (north), and Beverly Hills (west). Since the early 1900s, when moviemaking pioneers found in southern California an ideal blend of mild climate, much sunshine, varied terrain, and a large labour market, the image of Hollywood as the fabricator of tinseled cinematic dreams has been etched worldwide. The first house in Hollywood was an adobe building (1853) on a site near Los Angeles, then a small city in the new state of California. Hollywood was laid out as a real-estate subdivision in 1887 by Harvey Wilcox, a prohibitionist from Kansas who envisioned a community based on his sober religious principles. Real-estate magnate H.J. Whitley, known as the “Father of Hollywood,” subsequently transformed Hollywood into a wealthy and popular residential area. At the turn of the 20th century, Whitley was responsible for bringing telephone, electric, and gas lines into the new suburb. In 1910, because of an inadequate water supply, Hollywood residents voted to consolidate with Los Angeles.[P1]The Hollywood sign in Los Angeles.© franckreporter/iStock.com[ML1]In 1908 one of the first storytelling movies, The Count of Monte Cristo, was completed in Hollywood after its filming had begun in Chicago. In 1911 a site on Sunset Boulevard was turned into Hollywood’s first studio, and soon about 20 companies were producing films in the area. In 1913 Cecil B. DeMille, Jesse Lasky, Arthur Freed, and Samuel Goldwyn formed Jesse Lasky Feature Play Company (later Paramount Pictures). DeMille produced The Squaw Man in a barn one block from present-day Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, and more box-office successes soon followed. Hollywood had become the centre of the American film industry by 1915 as more independent filmmakers relocated there from the East Coast. For more than three decades, from early silent films through the advent of “talkies,” figures such as D.W. Griffith, Goldwyn, Adolph Zukor, William Fox, Louis B. Mayer, Darryl F. Zanuck, and Harry Cohn served as overlords of the great film studios—Twentieth Century-Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Columbia Pictures, Warner Brothers, and others. Among the writers who were fascinated by Hollywood in its “golden age” were F. Scott Fitzgerald, Aldous Huxley, Evelyn Waugh, and Nathanael West.[P2]After World War II, film studios began to move outside Hollywood, and the practice of filming “on location” emptied many of the famous lots and sound stages or turned them over to television show producers. With the growth of the television industry, Hollywood began to change, and by the early 1960s it had become the home of much of American network television entertainment.[P3]Among the features of Hollywood, aside from its working studios, are the Hollywood Bowl (1919; a natural amphitheatre used since 1922 for summertime concerts under the stars), the Greek Theatre in Griffith Park (also a concert venue), Mann’s (formerly Grauman’s) Chinese Theatre (with footprints and handprints of many stars in its concrete forecourt), and the Hollywood Wax Museum (with more than 350 wax figures of celebrities). The Hollywood Walk of Fame pays tribute to many celebrities of the entertainment industry. The most visible symbol of the district is the Hollywood sign that overlooks the area. First built in 1923 (a new sign was erected in 1978), the sign originally said “Hollywoodland” (to advertise new homes being developed in the area), but the sign fell into disrepair, and the “land” section was removed in the 1940s when the sign was refurbished.[P4]Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles.© Palette7/Shutterstock.com[ML4]Many stars, past and present, live in neighbouring communities such as Beverly Hills and Bel Air, and the Hollywood Forever Cemetery contains the crypts of such performers as Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks, and Tyrone Power. Hollywood Boulevard, long a chic thoroughfare, became rather tawdry with the demise of old studio Hollywood, but it underwent regeneration beginning in the late 20th century; the Egyptian Theatre (built in 1922), for example, was fully restored in the 1990s and became the home of the American Cinematheque, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the presentation of the motion picture.[P5] [END-OF-CONTENT]
California"Huntington Beach"City"Orange county"southwestern California"Huntington Beach, city, Orange county, southwestern California, U.S. Situated south of Los Angeles, it lies along the Pacific Coast Highway. Originally the territory of Gabrielino (Tongva) Indians, the city was formed from parts of Rancho Las Bolsas and Rancho Los Alamitos. It was first called Shell Beach and after its subdivision (1901) was known as Pacific City. To encourage its promotion as a seaside resort, it was renamed Huntington Beach for the railroad magnate Henry E. Huntington. The discovery of oil (1920) beneath the town site spurred the residential growth of the city and provided a basis for the city’s industrial development; after 1930 offshore tideland oil production began, but the oil industry has since undergone a substantial decline. Tourism, service industries, and technology assumed an increasing role in the city’s changing economy. Major economic assets include Boeing’s space centre and a large steam generating plant. Huntington Pier (originally built in 1914) is a popular tourist attraction. The city has been known for decades as Surf City, and Huntington State Beach is still a favourite venue for surfing.

The area was originally inhabited by Cahuilla Indians and was the site of Spanish and Mexican exploration in the late 18th century; the Spanish subsequently established a mission outpost there. The city was founded in 1876 as Indian Wells, on the site of Palte-Wat Indian village, by the Southern Pacific Railroad, and in 1877 it was renamed Indio (Spanish: “Indian”). In the 1850s local artesian wells were utilized for irrigation, and Collis P. Huntington, president of the railway, successfully introduced Algerian date shoots (a national date festival is held each February as part of the Riverside County Fair). Indio developed as a desert spa and a shipping point for agricultural produce, especially dates, citrus, grapes, vegetables, and cotton. After 1949 water via the All-American Canal gave added impetus to Indio’s growth. Light manufacturing, tourism, and nearby retirement communities supplement the agricultural economy. The city also hosts a popular tamale festival, several powwows, and an arts festival. Joshua Tree National Park is 25 miles (40 km) east, and San Bernardino National Forest is west of the city.

Originally inhabited by Tongva (or Gabrielino) Indians, the area was explored by Gaspar de Portolá in 1769. The land that would become the modern city (and one of the largest planned cities in the United States) was composed of parts of Ranchos Santiago de Santa Ana (1801), a Spanish land grant, and San Joaquin (1837) and Lomas de Santiago (1846), both Mexican land grants. By the 1860s much of the land had been acquired by sheep ranchers Benjamin and Thomas Flint, Llewellyn Bixby, and James Irvine (for whom the city is named). By 1876 Irvine had purchased the entire tract of what became known as the Irvine Ranch. His son inherited the land and established the Irvine Company in 1894. Irvine subsequently developed into a farming community, with crops that included barley, lima beans, olives, asparagus, strawberries, and oranges. During World War II, two U.S. Marine facilities were built on land formerly owned by the Irvine Company. The University of California, Irvine, was established in 1965 and is now the city’s leading employer; the campus houses the Irvine Barclay Theatre, which hosts concerts and other entertainment. The city is also the seat of Concordia University (1976) and a community college (1979). Other notable attractions are an amphitheatre, which holds up to 15,000 spectators for outdoor concerts, and the Irvine Museum (1993), which features California art from the Impressionist period. Irvine Ranch Land Reserve, with some 50,000 acres (20,000 hectares) of protected land—which constitutes more than half of the historic ranch—is popular for hiking, horseback riding, and bird-watching.

In 1876, when the Southern Pacific Railroad laid tracks through the area on its route between San Francisco and Los Angeles, the city’s growth was assured. It began as a Scottish settlement organized in 1884 by M.L. Wicks, who may have named it for his hometown in Pennsylvania (though the origins of the city’s name are somewhat in doubt). Both borax (still locally mined and economically significant) and gold were discovered in the foothills near the city in 1898. The valley largely supported cattle ranching until the early 1900s, when water, pumped by gasoline engines, transformed it into an agricultural area. Lancaster shares with Palmdale (south) development of aircraft, aerospace, and electronics industries; Lancaster’s Aerospace Walk of Honor (1990) is for test pilots who have made significant contributions to the industry.

The area was originally an Indian trading camp. In 1542 Spanish explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo anchored off the coast. The site became part of Rancho Nietos (1784), a Spanish land grant later divided; the portions later known as Los Alamitos and Los Cerritos made up most of what is now Long Beach. Laid out in 1880 by W.E. Willmore as Willmore City, the town was first settled in 1882. It was soon promoted as a seaside resort and was renamed (1888) for its 8.5-mile (13.5-km) beach.[P1]Long BeachLong Beach, California.Regular Daddy[ML1]Industrial and harbour development was stimulated by the discovery of oil in 1921 at Signal Hill, and Long Beach expanded with the post-World War II growth of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. It possesses tideland oil rights, and offshore city derricks are concealed as skyscrapers on landscaped islands. Land subsidence caused by the draining of oil pools has been contained by injections of seawater. In 1933 a severe earthquake caused widespread damage.[P2]Connected to the Los Angeles harbour by Los Cerritos Channel, Long Beach possesses extensive docking and storage facilities; its port is one of the world’s busiest. The city’s economy is dominated by manufacturing and services; diversified industries include the production of aircraft and ships, as well as oil refining, food processing, and marine research. It is the seat of Long Beach City (community) College (1927) and California State University, Long Beach (1949). In 1967 the city purchased the historic British transatlantic liner Queen Mary, which is moored in the harbour and functions as a maritime museum, meeting centre, and hotel; it adjoins the Long Beach Convention and Entertainment Center, one of the largest halls in the region. From 1983 to 1992 the legendary Spruce Goose airplane, built by Howard Hughes, was on display in the city; the plane subsequently was moved to Portland, Oregon, and the cavernous dome that housed it was converted into a movie studio.

At the start of the 20th century it was considered merely “a large village.” This ascendancy is all the more remarkable considering that the city originally lacked some of the essential building blocks associated with cityhood, such as a natural harbour. Yet it overcame natural deficiencies and established itself as an important centre of commerce, agriculture, tourism, and industry. For more than a century it has been indelibly associated with a benign climate, extensive leisure, and outdoor recreation, as well as the special aura of celebrity associated with Hollywood. The lifestyle of Los Angeles residents (who are called Angelenos) relies on the automobile, idealizes the single-family dwelling, and favours informality. With notable exceptions, the skyline is primarily horizontal rather than vertical. Los Angeles is a place of extraordinary ethnic and racial diversity, owing largely to immigration, and, like other world cities, it reflects a growing gap between rich and poor.[P3]Skyline of Los Angeles, California.© iStockphoto/Thinkstock[ML3] Los Angeles has endured the barbs of many detractors. Critics refer to it either as a laid-back “la-la land” or, conversely, as a place reeling from earthquakes, fire, smog, gang warfare, and riots. The city’s defenders admire its mild climate and geographic variety. They claim that its major social problems are similar to those of all big cities and are perhaps even less severe there than elsewhere. In fact, some observers regard it as the most modern and quintessential American city.[P4] [H3]Landscape City site Los Angeles county is a vast and varied geographic entity. It includes a group of inland valleys, a coastal plain separated by low mountains that are interspersed with steep passes, an arc of still higher mountains, and a long seacoast. Nearly half of the county is taken up by mountain chains—most of them running east-west—that have a dynamic history of earthquakes, firestorms, and mud slides. To the north and northeast are the massive and sprawling San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains. Stretching in front of them—and more or less in parallel lines from west to east—are the Santa Monica Mountains, Puente Hills, Repetto Hills, and San Jose Hills. These chains delineate the San Fernando, San Gabriel, and San Bernardino valleys. Farther south—running roughly between Orange and Riverside counties—are the Santa Ana Mountains. A magnificent natural feature of Los Angeles county is the coastline’s distinctive beaches, which attract millions of sun worshippers annually.[P5]Downtown Los Angeles cityscape.© Digital Vision/Getty Images[ML5] Three waterways cross the county: the westward-flowing Santa Clara River in the north; the Los Angeles River in the south, extending from the San Fernando Valley east and south to the Pacific Ocean; and the San Gabriel River, which rises from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north and flows south to the ocean. Huge floods have periodically inundated large parts of Los Angeles, and much human effort has gone into confining the waterways within concrete channels. In historic times (1825) a deluge permanently shifted the direction of the Los Angeles River channel from its westward outflow into Santa Monica Bay to a south-flowing outlet emptying into San Pedro Bay. In the winter of 1861–62, a flood left the western part of the Los Angeles basin looking like a chain of lakes dotted with islands. The San Gabriel River also overflowed its banks and at one point merged with the Los Angeles River via a new channel called the Rio Hondo.[P6]Los Angeles River: droughtA section of the Los Angeles River affected by drought.Joshua Rainey—iStock Editorial/Thinkstock[ML6] The huge, sprawling, and tortuously shaped city of Los Angeles occupies a sizable portion of the southern part of the county. It too has a varied topography, climbing from sea level at the beach community of Venice to Mount Lukens, which rises above 5,100 feet (1,550 metres). The city started in 1781 as a tiny village of 28 square miles (73 square km) but expanded greatly through a series of annexations when it first established an ironclad legal monopoly over the Los Angeles River watershed and then brought in a new water supply from the Owens River (which rises from the Sierra Nevada, 230 miles [370 km] northeast of the city). To share in this scarce water resource—and to receive much-needed police and fire protection—neighbouring communities elected to join the city. The annexations of Wilmington and San Pedro and a connecting narrow “shoestring” of land (1909–10) resulted when Los Angeles created a harbour and linked it to the city proper. By 1917 Los Angeles had tripled in size by adding the entire San Fernando Valley and the district of Palms. Between 1922 and 1928, 34 unincorporated areas and five cities merged with Los Angeles. As it grew, Los Angeles encircled five independent cities—Beverly Hills, Culver City, West Hollywood, Universal City, and San Fernando.[P7] Original city districts and annexed communities—Boyle Heights, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Hollywood, San Pedro, Encino, and Watts, for example—still retain their community names and identities. On the other hand, the city never recognized neighbourhoods as such, so these smaller units have only vague and informal boundaries.[P8] Climate The Los Angeles climate is typically classified as semiarid or Mediterranean. It results from a harmonious interplay of at least three natural conditions: the region’s latitude is far enough south to dissipate the most severe North Pacific winter storms, a cooling layer of marine air moderates the summer sun, and the tall mountain ranges shield the region from potentially intense blasts of desert heat and cold. However, the warm climate and the bowl-like alignment of the ranges also provide the ideal conditions for another well-known Los Angeles phenomenon: photochemical smog, which has remained a part of the landscape since the 1940s. Tough antipollution laws enacted by state and local authorities have helped reduce the motor-vehicle emissions contributing to smog formation, but air quality has continued to be a serious issue in Los Angeles, as well as in many other cities in the state.[P9] Of the region’s two seasons, one is a dry and moderately warm spell lasting roughly from April to November; the second is a wet, moderately cool, but rarely frigid period extending from November to April. The city’s mean temperature is about 64 °F (18 °C).[P10] Temperatures can differ widely depending on location. The San Fernando Valley can be 10 °F (5.5 °C) warmer than Santa Monica in the summer and 10 °F cooler in the winter. Fog, wind speed, and elevation also determine temperature. Beach areas tend to be 10 to 15 °F (5.5 to 8 °C) cooler than downtown Los Angeles. The hottest month, August, averages 85 °F (29 °C) downtown and 68 °F (20 °C) at the ocean, only 15 miles (24 km) away. Areas near the mountains in the San Gabriel Valley can reach 100 °F (38 °C) during the day and fall to the low 40s or 50s F (low to upper 20s C) at night. The coldest month overall is January, when icy roads can close the passes. Temperatures on the plains, however, rarely drop below 40 °F (4 °C).[P11] The annual precipitation in Los Angeles averages about 15 inches (380 mm). The central Pacific weather pattern known as El Niño has sometimes (but not always) produced more than twice the average precipitation in a given rainy season. Prolonged rains or shorter intense downpours can trigger mud slides (more properly debris slides), especially after fires have stripped hillsides of their vegetation.[P12] The many days of sun and comparative lack of rain add to a sense of physical well-being. Blasts of Santa Ana winds, usually hot and dry, streak through the mountain passes in the fall and winter. Mystery writer Raymond Chandler wrote that during these “red winds,” “Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands’ necks.”[P13] Natural environment Despite the great allure of the region’s natural environment, its other, less desirable elements—prolonged droughts, torrential rains, pounding surf, mud slides, wind-fanned fires, and especially earthquakes—pose serious challenges to human occupation. Earthquakes have been observed throughout the area’s recorded history. Juan Crespi, a Franciscan friar and colleague of missionary Junípero Serra’s, chronicled the expedition led by Gaspar de Portolá in 1769 and noted that a temblor lasting “as long as half an Ave Maria” toppled a soldier from his horse as they crossed the Santa Ana River. The major fault line slicing through the area is that of the San Andreas Fault, located at its closest point just 33 miles (53 km) from downtown Los Angeles. The greatest temblors have been those centred in Long Beach in 1933 (magnitude 6.4), Sylmar in 1971 (6.6), and Northridge in 1994 (6.7). The huge Pacific Plate (containing the portion of California west of the fault) is grinding northwestward past the North American landmass at a rate of about 2 inches (5 cm) per year; in theory, at least, in tens of millions of years southern California and Los Angeles will slide past San Francisco.[P14] Ranching, farming, and urbanization have destroyed much of the area’s original flora and fauna, yet native trees such as oaks, maples, sycamores, and willows are still abundant. The California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) blooms profusely in the spring near Lancaster, some 80 miles (130 km) north of the city, and the native chaparral blankets the mountains. Meanwhile, hundreds of exotic flowers, shrubs, and trees have been introduced. Because nearly every kind of plant can grow in the area, the flora is exceptionally varied. Most of the familiar palm trees are exotics, as are the eucalyptus and pepper trees. Animal species that were common in the 1850s, such as the grizzly and black bears and pronghorn antelope, are long gone, but deer, raccoons, and coyotes still roam in some areas. Even a few nocturnal mountain lions, a protected species, live in the hilly parts of Beverly Hills, Tarzana, and Chatsworth. The endangered El Segundo blue butterfly (Euphilotes battoides allyni) is native to the county.[P15] City layout The city of Los Angeles is composed of a series of widely dispersed settlements loosely connected to downtown. It certainly does not conform to the popular Chicago school of urban theory of the 1920s and later, which held that a downtown was the main focus of community life, with its influence unfolding in a series of concentric circles out into the hinterlands.[P16] Apart from those who work there, the vast majority of Angelenos have little connection with downtown in their daily lives and are content to work, shop, and pursue recreation in the suburbs that stretch out in all directions. Among the outlying districts that lie within the city limits are Hollywood, located northwest of downtown; Encino, Van Nuys, and North Hollywood in the San Fernando Valley; Century City, Westwood, and Venice on the West Side; San Pedro and Wilmington in the harbour area; and Boyle Heights just east of the river. Some of the newer outlying communities, such as Warner Center, have the appearance of self-contained mini-cities.[P17] The main links connecting downtown and the suburbs are the famed Los Angeles freeways, which spread throughout the region in a vast network of concrete ribbons. A drive in any direction presents a variety of landscapes. Some roads cross the Los Angeles River, which appears in the guise of a huge, cement-lined flood-control channel. The mountains and their steep-walled canyons are lined with shrubbery, grass, and occasional houses. Motorists glimpse some dramatic vistas; for example, a nighttime view of the San Fernando Valley from the Mulholland summit of the San Diego Freeway. In general, however, there is little to distinguish one community from another as viewed from the freeways. Cars and trucks move in solid masses, streaming steadily along at rooftop level through single-story residential areas, shopping strips, and malls.[P18]Los Angeles: highwayCloverleaf interchange on a highway, Los Angeles.© iofoto/Fotolia[ML18] There is no single manufacturing area in Los Angeles. The typical industrial establishment occupies a single-story building next to a large parking lot and can be found alongside a railroad line or near a major road or freeway that is accessed by giant trucks. All of this tends to illustrate why writer Dorothy Parker is said to have once described Los Angeles as “seventy-two suburbs in search of a city.”[P19] Anyone familiar with a city like Chicago and its grid-based street pattern may justifiably believe that Los Angeles was never planned. The English architectural writer Reyner Banham called planning in Los Angeles “a self-canceling concept.” Yet the Spanish colonists had established the original pueblo in 1781 according to a plan laid out in the 16th-century Laws of the Indies, and the county later maintained a general grid for outlying tracts, roads, and highways. An imaginative and extensive regional planning proposal to preserve open space, completed in 1924 by the planning firm headed by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., failed to gather enough support to slow the powerful tendencies toward urban sprawl and the preference for automobiles. Still, the original designs of smaller planned communities in outlying areas such as Westwood and Palos Verdes Estates have achieved acclaim.[P20] Downtown Los Angeles brings hundreds of thousands of Angelenos to its government and commercial offices and its cultural facilities. It has distinctive subareas—Civic Center, Music Center, Spring Street, Broadway, Chinatown, Olvera Street, Little Tokyo, Library Square, and the Staples Center. Although these areas are crowded during workdays, most are nearly deserted in the evenings. Bunker Hill has by and large the tallest, newest, and most-imposing buildings in the city. Downtown has never housed many factories and lost most of its major department stores, theatres, restaurants, and residences when the freeways were constructed; it also has relatively few residents. The wholesale marts for garments, jewelry, toys, furniture, flowers, and produce, however, are among the busiest enterprises anywhere in southern California.[P21] Since the 1980s, the city has taken significant steps to redevelop downtown by increasing housing stock, accommodating new recreational and cultural activities, and inviting pedestrian activity. Loft conversions have created new condominium living spaces. The river is seen as a major recreational asset. Downtown’s greatest deficiencies are its large Skid Row area (sometimes called Central City East) and its lack of housing for middle- and lower-income families and the shops and amenities that make life agreeable at street level.[P22] [H4]People The relative positions of ethnic and racial groups in Los Angeles have shifted significantly with time. When the city began under Spanish rule in 1781, whites (i.e., people of European ancestry) were in the minority. Twenty-six of the 44 original settlers were of African, Native American, or mixed ancestry. From the late 19th to the early 20th century, whites became dominant; so many white Midwesterners arrived in Los Angeles during that time that it was nicknamed “the seacoast of Iowa.” With the exception of some eastern European Jews who arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, southern California drew relatively few of the immigrant groups from eastern and southern Europe that populated the cities of the eastern United States. With the start of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 and the subsequent influx of Mexican agricultural workers in California, the nonwhite population began to increase. In the 1970s Los Angeles attracted many other ethnic groups, and in the course of the subsequent decades it became one of the most diverse metropolises in the country, if not in the world.[P23] In the early years of the 21st century, California reached the status of a “minority-majority state”—one in which the combined population of minorities exceeds the majority population. Los Angeles county has the largest Hispanic (the term Latino is also used in southern California), Asian, and Native American populations of any county in the United States. African Americans make up about one-tenth of the total population; in the early 21st century their numbers declined somewhat as middle-class families abandoned the traditionally African American neighbourhoods for newer suburbs as far away as San Bernardino county. Compton and Inglewood, which once had African American majorities, have become predominantly Latino.[P24]Women performing a traditional Mexican dance at a Cinco de Mayo celebration in Los Angeles, 2002.Kevork Djansezian/AP[ML24] The shifts among the major ethnic groups have been the result of both natural increase (higher birth rates than death rates) and immigration. Since the mid-1960s, federal immigration practices have ceased giving preference to Europeans and have favoured immigrants with family already in the country and those having higher education and skills. Meanwhile, illegal immigration has increased dramatically from rural areas of Mexico and Central America, where the birth rate has been relatively high. Both legal and illegal immigration have contributed to the county’s having the largest concentration of Mexicans outside Mexico. People from more than 140 countries now reside in Los Angeles county. Los Angeles has more Koreans, Filipinos, Iranians, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, and Cambodians living outside their native countries than anywhere else in the world and a greater concentration of Native Americans—most of whom were born in states other than California—than any other county in the United States.[P25] The overall population of the city and county may have become more diverse, but, for low-income Latinos, African Americans, and Asians in the central city, housing has remained largely segregated. Families of all groups who could afford to do so usually have moved to the suburbs to find better homes and to escape crime-ridden neighbourhoods.[P26] More than 90 languages other than English are spoken in homes around Los Angeles, most notably Spanish, Vietnamese, Hmong, Cantonese, Tagalog, Korean, Armenian, Russian, Farsi, Cambodian, and Hebrew. In a given week, radio listeners can hear perhaps a dozen or more different foreign languages on the air, and newspaper readers may choose from more than 50 foreign-language newspapers published in the county.[P27] The religious culture of southern California is equally diverse. Long an almost exclusively Roman Catholic town, Los Angeles began receiving many Protestants and some Jews in the late 19th century. Small sects proliferated in the 1920s. While most were short-lived and had narrow appeal, at least one gained vast influence. William J. Seymour, an African American preacher, created the Azusa Street revival in 1906 and sparked the Pentecostal religious movement that, for the next century, would spread like wildfire throughout the Western Hemisphere and other parts of the world. In 1921 the prominent California newspaperman and poet John Steven McGroarty wrote, “Los Angeles is the most celebrated of all incubators of new creeds, codes of ethics, philosophies—no day passes without the birth of something of this nature never heard of before.” Roman Catholics still constitute the most numerous mainline religious group in Los Angeles, with about 100 parishes. Various Protestant sects, including Evangelicals, have come to outnumber members of mainline denominations. There is also a significant number of Mormons. The African Methodist Episcopal church remains a stalwart of the African American community. Some 600,000 Jews live in Los Angeles, and Eastern Orthodox congregations are active in the growing Greek, Russian, and Armenian communities. Islam’s many adherents in Los Angeles include immigrants from Africa and Indonesia. Buddhists and Hindus number in the tens of thousands in Los Angeles county. Smaller non-Judeo-Christian religions, such as the Bahaʾi faith, have also proliferated.[P28] Page 1 of 3 Next page Economy

Smith). Martinez was originally a trading post, and it became a shipping centre after gold was discovered in the vicinity. In the late 19th century, the city was heavily settled by Italian immigrants, who developed a wine industry there that was later relocated to Napa Valley.[P1]Martinez: John Muir National Historic SiteJohn Muir National Historic Site, Martinez, Calif.Courtesy National Park Service[ML1]The completion of the Contra Costa Canal (1947) to its Martinez Reservoir terminus and the opening of the Benicia-Martinez Bridge (1962) across the strait (with construction of a new bridge begun in 1999) boosted the city’s port and industrial development (petroleum, chemicals, steel, and copper). Local attractions include the Martinez Museum and the Don Vicente Martinez Adobe (built 1849). Martinez is the birthplace of baseball player Joe DiMaggio. It is also said to be the birthplace of the martini (originally called the “Martinez Special” by a local bartender in 1849), though San Francisco and other cities also have made such claims.

It became part of the Rancho de las Pulgas, a Mexican land grant established in 1800. The city was founded in 1854 by Dennis J. Oliver and D.C. McGlynn, two Irishmen who named the city for Menlough, County Galway, Ireland. Menlo Park began as a village for railroad and estate workers. Brief incorporation (1874–76) included Fair Oaks (later Atherton) and Ravenswood (later East Palo Alto). During World War I, the population of the city increased, as Camp Fremont (for U.S. Army engineers) occupied most of the downtown area and trained some 40,000 soldiers. During World War II, Dibble General Hospital (1943–46) was built to provide services for injured soldiers from the Pacific theatre. After World War II, Menlo Park developed as a residential community with an office-building boom, highlighted by the Stanford Research Institute (1946; now SRI International).

The area was originally inhabited by Costanoan Indians, and in 1542 it was first seen by the Spanish explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo. In 1602 Sebastián Vizcaíno named the area in honour of the count de Monte Rey, viceroy of New Spain (Mexico). In 1770 Gaspar de Portolá established a presidio (military post) at the site, and Junípero Serra founded the Mission San Carlos Borroméo (moved to Carmel in 1771). Named the capital of Alta California in 1775, Monterey was fortified and became a port of entry and centre of Spanish culture. Under Mexico, Monterey remained the capital of a vast area that included all of present-day California and the American Southwest. In 1846 Commodore John Drake Sloat claimed the area for the United States and raised the American flag over the town’s presidio during the Mexican War.

Captain Samuel S. Dunnells sailed into the bay in 1870 looking for “new port” facilities; he developed Newport Landing, which in 1873 became a lumber terminal. Known as McFaddens Landing and Port Orange, it was laid out in 1892 as Newport. It developed around yachting, sport and commercial fishing, and beach activities and as a residential community for commuters to Los Angeles and Long Beach. Light industry, mainly aerospace electronics, also has developed. Encompassing Lido Isle, Balboa Island and Peninsula, and Corona Del Mar, the city has extensive marina facilities and is a leading yacht rendezvous. The Balboa Pavilion (1905), with ferry connections to Santa Catalina Island, is a popular attraction. Newport Beach is home to the Newport Harbor Art Museum and the Orange County Museum of Art.

California"Norwalk"City"Los Angeles county"southwestern California"Norwalk, city, Los Angeles county, southwestern California, U.S. Located 17 miles (27 km) southeast of Los Angeles, the city was originally inhabited by Chumash Indians. The area was once a part of the Rancho Los Coyotes, a subdivision (1834) of the 1784 Spanish land grant known as Rancho Los Nietos. In 1869 Gilbert and Atwood Sproul purchased the land, and in 1873, after the railroad crossed the “North-walk” area, the Sprouls founded the city as Corvallis; the following year it was renamed Norwalk. The city developed as a service point for logging, dairying, and ranching. Norwalk was also known as a centre for some of southern California’s largest sugar beet farms. It experienced rapid industrial development in the second half of the 20th century. The house built in 1870 by Gilbert Sproul was moved to Norwalk City Park and is now a museum.

The area was once the territory of Miwok Indians. Ownership of the land was granted to Fernando Feliz in 1839, and his Rancho de Novato made up part of what is now the city of Novato. Also significant to area history was the grant in 1843 of Olompali (Rancho del Indio) to Carmilo Ynitia, son of the last chief of the Miwok. Francis C. DeLong and Joseph Sweetser acquired the land in 1856; they planted an enormous orchard, said to be one of the largest in the world, and exported fruit worldwide. In 1888 the Home and Farm Company purchased the land from DeLong’s son and founded the community. It remained a small agricultural village until 1935, when Hamilton Field (later Hamilton Air Force Base; deactivated 1975) was established. Development since the mid-20th century has been mainly residential. The city is headquarters for Birkenstock Footprint Sandals, and it has some high-technology businesses. The Buck Institute conducts biomedical research on the aging process. The College of Marin has a campus in Novato. Notable local attractions include the Novato History Museum (1976), housed in a building erected c. 1850, and the Marin Museum of the American Indian.

California"Oakland"City"Alameda county"west-central California"Oakland, city, seat (1873) of Alameda county, west-central California, U.S. It lies on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay opposite San Francisco. The city site is located on a flat coastal plain that rises toward hills to the east that parallel the shoreline. Oakland has a mild, Mediterranean-type climate with warm sunny summers and cool winters with rainy spells. Like its neighbour to the west, it experiences morning fogs in summer, though these typically burn off by noon.[P1]Downtown Oakland, Calif.© Index Open[ML1]Oakland is the eastern locus of the extensive metropolitan area surrounding the bay that, in addition to San Francisco, is anchored by San Jose to the southeast. Neighbouring communities include Berkeley (north), San Leandro (south), and Alameda (west, on Alameda Island), and Oakland completely surrounds the city of Piedmont. Area city, 78 square miles (202 square km). Pop.

In 1820 a Spanish land grant known as Rancho San Antonio was established there. Logging began in the area in the 1840s, and, during the California Gold Rush (1849), it became a transit centre for goods and people. In 1849–50 Moses Chase, a squatter, and some associates leased and then purchased farmland and laid out the town of Clinton (later named Brooklyn). In 1851 Horace W. Carpentier started a trans-bay ferry service to San Francisco and acquired a town site (1852) to the west of Brooklyn, naming it Oakland for the oak trees on the grassy plain. Carpentier and his associates extended the area and incorporated it as a city in 1854. Oakland and Brooklyn—separated by a slough that had been bridged in 1853—amalgamated in 1872.[P3] Chosen as the western terminus of the first transcontinental railroad (1869), Oakland began developing its harbour. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, it received a large influx of refugees, which boosted its population significantly. The 8.25-mile- (13-km-) long San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge to San Francisco (opened 1936) and military and naval installations (built in the 1940s) stimulated further population growth and heavy and diversified industrial expansion. Notable was the influx of African Americans seeking work in the city’s factories during World War II.[P4]San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge.© Index Open[ML4] By 1960, however, the city was in decline. The population, having reached a peak of about 385,000 in 1950, began to drop, and inner-city areas were beset by poverty, urban blight, and crime. Racial tension grew in Oakland’s large African American community, and the revolutionary Black Panther Party was founded there in 1966 and became a leading force in the black power movement. One of its members, Bobby Seale, ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1973; four years later Lionel Wilson became the city’s first black mayor.[P5] Efforts to rejuvenate the city began in the early 1970s, bolstered by the completion in 1972 of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) light-rail link to San Francisco. Over the next three decades, much of the city centre was rebuilt, and many run-down neighbourhoods were gentrified. Oakland’s population rebounded in the 1980s and surpassed the 1950 level in the 1990s. Although the city’s African Americans remained the largest component of the population, their numbers began to decline, and those for Hispanics increased to more than one-fifth of the total. Oakland’s revitalization was dealt a setback on October 17, 1989, when a strong earthquake caused significant damage to the Bay Bridge and caused a section of a major highway along the bay (a portion of it double-decked) to collapse; repairs on these were completed by the late 1990s.[P6] [H3]The contemporary city Oakland’s economy is now highly diversified. Although industry (food processing, light manufacturing, and high technology) is important, most economic activity is focused on business services, health care, transportation, retail trade, and other services. The city’s deepwater port (on an estuary between Alameda Island and the bay shore) covers 19 miles (31 km) of waterfront in outer, middle, and inner harbours. Metropolitan Oakland International Airport fronts the bay to the southwest.[P7] Oakland is the site of several institutions of higher education, including Mills College (1852), Holy Names University (1868), and California College of the Arts (1907); the Berkeley campus of the University of California is just to the north. The city has a symphony orchestra and ballet and numerous dance and theatre companies. Notable museums include the Oakland Museum (with exhibits of art, history, and natural science), Chabot Space and Science Center in the eastern hills, and the Western Aerospace Museum near the airport.[P8] Jack London Square, an area of restaurants, shops, and other attractions along the inner harbour near downtown, honours the American writer, who lived in the city during his youth; a bar Jack London frequented, Heinold’s First and Last Chance Saloon (1883), has been designated a national literary landmark. The USS Potomac, a yacht (dubbed “the Floating White House”) used during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, is docked at the square’s wharf. Farther inland is the Pardee Home (1869), built by an early civic leader and preserved as a museum.[P9] Lake Merritt, a saltwater lagoon near the central business district, is a wildfowl refuge surrounded by parkland. To the east is Morcom Rose Garden, a popular venue for weddings. Knowland Park, in the far south, contains Oakland Zoo, and a series of regional parks stretches along the eastern hills. The city is the home of the Golden State Warriors (basketball), Oakland Raiders (gridiron football), and Oakland Athletics (baseball) professional sports teams.[P10] [END-OF-CONTENT]

The region was originally territory of the Luiseño Indians. Bounded to the south by Carlsbad and to the east by Vista, it developed as a beach resort and an agricultural-trade centre after the arrival of the California Southern Railway (a branch of the Santa Fe) in 1883. The city grew rapidly after the establishment in 1942 of Camp Pendleton, a U.S. Marine Corps base, to the north (situated on the former Spanish land grant known as Rancho Margarita y las Flores). Agriculture is economically important, with crops including tomatoes, avocados, and citrus fruit. Growth accelerated again in the 1990s, when Oceanside became a bedroom community of the San Diego urban area. The city’s many beaches are popular for surfing. Fishing and whale watching are also common activities. The nearby Mission San Luis Rey de Francia (founded in 1798 and the 18th in the California chain of 21 missions) has been restored.

When the settlement was first laid out in 1874, it was named Nordhoff for Charles Nordhoff, a California booster and author of California for Health, Pleasure and Residence (1872). In 1917 the community was renamed Ojai, derived from the Chumash word a’hwai (“moon”), and homeowners were encouraged to remodel or maintain their structures in the Spanish Mission style. Ojai later attracted artists and crafts people as residents, as well as various spiritualists and religionists advocating meditation, yoga, theosophy, naturalism, astrology, and holism. Tourists are attracted not only by the scenic valley—where many of the scenes of Shangri-La in the classic film Lost Horizon (1937) were shot—but also by an abundance of pottery studios, antique stores, galleries, shops, and boutiques. The Ojai Valley Tennis Tournament, established in 1895, is held annually in April; the Ojai Festival, featuring music and dramatic readings, occurs in May and June.

California"Rancho Cucamonga"City"San Bernardino county"southern California"Rancho Cucamonga, city, San Bernardino county, southern California, U.S. Part of the “Inland Empire” region (comprising San Bernardino and Riverside counties), it is located on an alluvial plain near the eastern end of the San Gabriel Mountains, 37 miles (60 km) east of central Los Angeles. The area, originally inhabited by the Tongva (or Gabrielino) Indians (its name derives from the Indian word kukamonga, meaning “sandy place”), was explored in 1769 by a Spanish expedition led by Gaspar de Portolá. It became part of a land grant issued to Tiburcio Tapía (1839), who there established a winery (the oldest in the state and the second oldest in the United States). Rancho de Cucamonga was bought in 1858 by John Rains and his wife; their home, Casa de Rancho Cucamonga (built 1860), has been restored and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1870 the land was bought by San Francisco businessmen who formed the Cucamonga Company. By 1887 a railway was providing a link to the area, which subsequently was subdivided into three communities: Cucamonga, Alta Loma, and Etiwanda; the towns voted to incorporate as Rancho Cucamonga in 1977. The economic mainstay of the communities was agriculture, particularly citrus fruits, olives, and peaches, and there were also vineyards. The city is now largely residential, with some manufacturing and aerospace industries and retail businesses. The area was long a transportation centre, with trails and roads (e.g., the Cajon Pass; the Mojave, Old Spanish, and Sante Fe trails; El Camino Real [“King’s Highway”]; the Butterfield Stagecoach Route; and Route 66) crossing through the city. A community college was established in Rancho Cucamonga in 1883, and there are also satellite campuses of the University of Redlands and the University of La Verne. The city hosts an annual Grape Harvest Festival (first held in 1939). San Bernardino and Angeles national forests are north of the city. Inc. 1977. Pop.

California"Red Bluff"City"Tehama county"northern California"Red Bluff, city, seat (1857) of Tehama county, northern California, U.S. It lies along the Sacramento River, 115 miles (185 km) north-northwest of Sacramento. Settled in the 1840s, it was known as Leodocia until sometime before 1854, when it was renamed for the reddish sand and low bluffs on which it stands. In the 1850s it was a supply centre for the Trinity goldfields and a busy port for paddle-wheel steamers, but river traffic declined when the water level fell because of irrigation. The city remains a marketing centre for the livestock and farm produce (particularly peaches) of the upper Sacramento River valley. Lumbering and wood industries are also important. The Red Bluff Roundup is a popular rodeo held annually in April. The area was the home of William B. Ide, who served as president of the short-lived Bear Flag republic (1846); his nearby adobe is now maintained as a state historic park.

In the 1770s the valley was visited by Spanish explorer Pedro Fages, who named the river for the Christian religious sacraments. German-born Swiss pioneer John Sutter established the colony of Nueva Helvetia (New Switzerland) in 1839 on the site, a Mexican land grant, and beginning in 1840 built a palisaded trading post known as Sutter’s Fort (now a state historic park). His community, initially populated by fellow Swiss immigrants, prospered as an agricultural centre and as a refuge for American pioneers until the 1849 Gold Rush. It was at a sawmill that Sutter was constructing, about 35 miles (55 km) northeast on the American River, near Coloma, that his chief carpenter, James W. Marshall, found the first gold on January 24, 1848. Hordes of prospectors pillaged Sutter’s property, and, deeply in debt, he deeded his lands to his son, who laid out the present city that year.[P3]Sutter's Fort State Historic Park, Sacramento, California, U.S.Hans Hannau—Rapho/Photo Researchers[ML3] Profiting from the mining trade, Sacramento grew rapidly and was the scene of an armed squatter’s riot over the legality of Sutter’s grant. With a population of more than 10,000 in 1854, it was chosen the state capital. In its early decades Sacramento suffered several devastating floods and fires; subsequent measures (levees and masonry construction) alleviated these problems. A hub of river transportation since Sutter started a steamer service, Sacramento was the western terminus of the Pony Express and the first California railroad (1856; the Sacramento Valley Railroad to Folsom). More significantly, four Sacramento merchants—Charles Crocker, Mark Hopkins, Collis P. Huntington, and Leland Stanford—financed the construction of the Central Pacific Railroad. Stretching eastward from the city, it completed the country’s first transcontinental rail link when it was joined to the Union Pacific Railroad at Promontory Point, Utah, in May 1869.[P4]A discussion concerning the history and the impact of the railroad, from the documentary Binding Ties: The California State Railroad Museum.Great Museums Television[ML4] In 1862 the Central Pacific Railroad Central Shops were located in Sacramento, and they were until the 1950s the largest employer in the city, with employment peaking around 5,000 persons during World War II. The shops were one of the largest industrial sites west of the Mississippi River, and, until they closed in 1993, virtually every piece of Central (later Southern) Pacific rolling stock was either built or serviced in these shops. Today the 245-acre (100-hectare) site is one of the country’s largest urban infill projects, planned to accommodate a mixed-use development around a core of historic shop buildings, the oldest of which dates from 1869. [P5] The Sacramento River was dredged in the early 20th century, which provided ships seasonal access to the sea; a newer canal, opened in 1963 to San Francisco Bay, made Sacramento a year-round deepwater port.[P6] After the Gold Rush heyday, Sacramento’s population grew steadily until the first decades of the 20th century, when it began to increase more rapidly. People were drawn to the region’s expanding agriculture-related industries and, from the 1940s, its military installations (now closed). The city began annexing much of the land surrounding it (including the city of North Sacramento in 1964), increasing its area sevenfold between 1940 and 2000; in that same period Sacramento’s population nearly quadrupled. Citizens of European ancestry, long the great majority of the city’s population, now constitute less than half. Hispanics represent the fastest-growing component, accounting for more than one-fifth the total; there are also significant groups of African Americans and people of Asian ancestry.[P7] [H3]The contemporary city Sacramento is the centre of the region’s extensive agricultural production—primarily dairy products, poultry, beef cattle, fruits and vegetables (especially grapes, pears, and tomatoes), wheat, rice, and corn (maize). The city’s traditional economic base of government and other services and agriculture has been expanded to include electronics manufacturing, computer software production, tourism, and the manufacture of metal products and scientific instruments.

Sighted in 1542 and named San Miguel by Spanish explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, the area was renamed for the Spanish monk San Diego de Alcalá de Henares in 1602 by Sebastián Vizcaíno. Gaspar de Portolá founded a presidio (military post) there on July 16, 1769, and, on the same day, Father Junípero Serra dedicated the first of the California missions (restored 1931). Settlement was confined inside the presidio walls until the 1820s, when residents began to build the area known as Old Town. Control of the mission was assumed by Mexico in 1834, and the site was redesignated a pueblo (town). After the United States acquired California in 1846, the community was incorporated (1850), but it lost its charter two years later. The new city of San Diego was laid out 3 miles (5 km) south of Old Town by businessman Alonzo E. Horton in 1867, and its growth was ensured by the promotion of its salubrious climate and the arrival of the Santa Fe Railway in 1885.[P4]Cabrillo, Juan RodríguezJuan Rodríguez Cabrillo, sculpture in San Diego, Calif.© Andy Z./Shutterstock.com[ML4] Growth was rapid after 1900, the population jumping from fewer than 20,000 that year to more than 200,000 by 1940. The city’s traditional economic base of agriculture (citrus) and fishing was expanded to include manufacturing (notably aircraft) and, after the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, shipping. The Panama-California Exposition (1915–16) celebrated the enormous economic boon the new waterway gave the city.[P5]Map of San Diego, California, U.S. (c. 1900), from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML5] Also of great importance was the increasing military presence, especially of the U.S. Navy. Major installations established there included Naval Base Point Loma (1898; originally a U.S. Army fort), the Marine Corps Recruit Depot (1911), Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (originally the Army’s Camp Kearney) and Naval Air Station North Island (both 1917), Naval Base San Diego (1919), and Naval Amphibious Base Coronado (1943); in addition, Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton (1942) was set up a short distance northwest, near Oceanside.[P6] World War II ushered in even more rapid growth, which only increased after the war. San Diego’s land area and population each nearly quadrupled between 1950 and 2000. Industry expanded to include electronics, aerospace technology, and shipbuilding. In addition, the area’s equable climate, which had been a significant factor in attracting manufacturing and the military, drew growing numbers of retirees and tourists.[P7] [H3]The contemporary city San Diego has a culturally diverse population. People of European ancestry, once the great majority of the population, still constitute more than half of the total. A growing one-fourth are now Hispanic, and more than one-eighth are of Asian descent. Despite the large number of retirees, the population is relatively young, about half of the residents being under age 35. The city has one of the country’s highest percentages of college graduates. There is also a significant presence of Mexican labourers who commute to jobs (typically as farmworkers or domestics) in the San Diego region from their homes south of the border.[P8]Skyline of San Diego, Calif., at sunrise.Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty Images[ML8] The city’s economy, long dominated by the military, is now more diversified. Defense industries such as aerospace are still important, but tourism and nondefense manufacturing also play major roles. High-technology industries, particularly biotechnology and telecommunications, grew rapidly at the end of the 20th century. Software, financial and business services, environmental technology, shipbuilding and repair, and the manufacture of electronics, computer equipment, medical products, pharmaceuticals, and sporting goods are all important economic factors. The city remains the main commercial outlet for the farm produce of southern California. San Diego also is one of the leading agricultural counties in the United States in the value of production. Citrus, avocados, cut flowers, nursery plants, eggs, cucumbers, tomatoes, and livestock are the major products.[P9] San Diego’s location on the Pacific Ocean near the border with Mexico is advantageous for international trade, particularly with Latin America and the Pacific Rim. The Port of San Diego serves as a berth for cruise ships, and a variety of cargo passes through its docks, including lumber, automobiles, cement, sand, soda ash, newsprint, fertilizer, and food products. The city has an international airport, and its mass transit system includes trolley service to the Mexican border.[P10]San Diego International AirportSan Diego International Airport.Ted McGrath[ML10] The University of California, San Diego (1912), in La Jolla, includes the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (1903), and San Diego State University (1897) is part of the California State University system. Other institutions of higher education include the University of San Diego (1949) and several community colleges. Other cultural amenities include a symphony orchestra and opera, ballet, and theatre companies. The city is also home to the Padres professional baseball team.[P11]Manchester Hall at San Diego State University, San Diego.© Jim Feliciano/Shutterstock.com[ML11] The 1,200-acre (485-hectare) Balboa Park, near downtown, contains the world-renowned San Diego Zoo; a variety of arts and cultural organizations, such as the Globe Theatres and the Japanese Friendship Garden; and more than a dozen museums, including those devoted to natural history, fine art, photography, aerospace, folk art, anthropology, and local history. Mission Bay Park, just north of Point Loma, encompasses 4,600 acres (1,860 hectares) of land and water, with beaches, marinas, water-recreation activities, and wildlife preserves. Mission Bay is also the site of SeaWorld, an aquatic theme park famous for its shows featuring killer whales. San Diego Wild Animal Park, near Escondido, showcases groups of exotic animals roaming throughout 1,800 acres (730 hectares) of habitat similar to their native Africa and Asia. Old Town San Diego State Historic Park, on the 19th-century settlement site, displays artifacts and restored buildings, and the nearby Serra Museum stands on the location of the original presidio. Cabrillo National Monument, established in 1913, preserves Old Point Loma Lighthouse (built in 1855).[P12]Old Point Loma Lighthouse, San Diego.© Jim Feliciano/Shutterstock.com[ML12] Opportunities for outdoor recreational activities abound in the region’s warm, sunny climate and varied landscape. Beaches and resorts line the coast and include Torrey Pines State Reserve (north) and Border Field State Park and Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve (south). Ocean Beach and Pacific Beach, two districts in the city near Mission Bay, preserve a charming laid-back, beach-community atmosphere. Inland, Cleveland National Forest (headquartered in San Diego) extends north-south through the county. Farther east are Cuyamaca Rancho and the vast Anza-Borrego Desert state parks. Mexican border attractions are easily reached from the city.[P13] [END-OF-CONTENT]
California"San Fernando"City""southern California"San Fernando, city and enclave within the city of Los Angeles, southern California, U.S. It lies in the northeastern San Fernando Valley. Named for the Mission San Fernando Rey de España (established 1797 by Father Fermín de Lasuén), which is now preserved as a historic site, it was promoted in 1874 by two land developers, G.K. Porter and Senator Charles Maclay (who also founded a college of theology there in 1887). The San Fernando Reservoir (just northwest) is the southern terminus of the Los Angeles (Owens River) Aqueduct (1913), which irrigated the valley and gave the city a citrus-based economy. Later, diversified industries developed, chiefly electronics and clothing manufacture. Los Angeles Mission (community) College (1975) is located in nearby Sylmar.

According to the dream, San Franciscans are sophisticates whose lives hold full measures of such civilized pleasures as music, art, and good food. Their children are to be pitied, for, as the wife of publishing magnate Nelson Doubleday once said, “They will probably grow up thinking all cities are so wonderful.” To San Franciscans their city is a magical place, almost an island, saved by its location and history from the sprawl and monotony that afflicts so much of urban California.[P2]South San FranciscoSouth San Francisco, Calif.Coolcaesar[ML2] Since World War II, however, San Francisco has had to face the stark realities of urban life: congestion, air and water pollution, violence and vandalism, and the general decay of the inner city. San Francisco’s makeup has been changing as families, mainly white and middle-class, have moved to its suburbs, leaving the city to a population that, viewed statistically, tends to be older and to have fewer married people. Now almost one of every two San Franciscans is “nonwhite”—in this case African American, East Asian, Filipino, Samoan, Vietnamese, Latin American, or Native American. Their dreams increasingly demand a realization that has little to do with the romantic dream of San Francisco. But both the dreams and the realities are important, for they are interwoven in the fabric of the city that might be called Paradox-by-the-Bay.[P3] Although San Franciscans complain of the congestion, homelessness, and high cost of living that plague the city and talk endlessly of the good old days, the majority still think of San Francisco the way poet George Sterling did, as “the cool grey city of love,” America’s most attractive, colourful, and distinctive place to live.[P4] [H3]Landscape City site Hilly and roughly square, San Francisco occupies the northern tip of a peninsula. To its south are the bedroom suburbs of San Mateo county, to the east and northeast is the bay, and to the west and northwest lies the Pacific Ocean.[P5]Aerial view of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML5] The most prominent of San Francisco’s hills are Twin Peaks, Mount Davidson, and Mount Sutro, all of which exceed 900 feet (270 metres) in elevation. The best known are Nob Hill, where the wealthy “nobs” (nabobs) built extravagant mansions in the 1870s, and Telegraph Hill, which once looked down on the Barbary Coast, a neighbourhood formerly alive with gaudy wickedness. As a result of the pioneer planners’ prejudice in favour of a squared-off grid, the downtown streets march intrepidly up precipitous slopes, terrifying newly arrived drivers, making the cable cars more than sentimental anachronisms, and providing splendid views of the bay.[P6]San FranciscoSan Francisco.© Pixelshop/Fotolia[ML6] San Francisco Bay is a drowned river valley, submerged during the melting of the last glacial ice sheet. Enthusiastic and profitable filling of the tidelands has reduced its area at mean high tide from about 700 square miles (1,800 square km) in 1880 to a mere 435 square miles (1,125 square km). More than half of the bay is still fillable, but in 1965 the state legislature created the Bay Conservation and Development Commission to control further landfill projects. At its widest extent the bay measures 13 miles (21 km) across; its deepest point, 357 feet (109 metres), is in the Golden Gate, a narrow channel between the peninsula and Marin county to the north that connects the bay to the Pacific. The maximum daily flow of water through the Golden Gate into the Pacific is seven times the flow of the Mississippi River at its mouth.[P7]Alcatraz IslandAlcatraz Island, in San Francisco Bay, California.© MedioImages/Getty Images[ML7] Within the portion of San Francisco Bay lying inside the city limits are the natural islands of Alcatraz and Yerba Buena and man-made Treasure Island, created for a world’s fair in 1939 and later turned into a naval base (1941–93). Alcatraz (Spanish: “Pelican”) was from 1934 to 1963 the most notorious maximum-security, “escape-proof” prison in the United States. In 1969, after the decaying cell blocks had been given up by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a multi-tribal group of Native Americans invaded the island and asserted their rights to abandoned federal property, but they were forcibly evicted in 1971. The island became part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1972 and has become a popular tourist attraction.[P8]Alcatraz Island, in San Francisco Bay, California.© Fabio Formaggio/Dreamstime.com[ML8] Climate Winter in San Francisco is rainy and mild, spring sunny and temperate, summer foggy and cool, and autumn sunny and warm. The average minimum temperature is 51 °F (11 °C), and the average maximum is 63 °F (17 °C). The mean rainfall, almost all of which occurs between November and April, is about 21 inches (533 mm). There is sunshine during two-thirds of the possible daylight hours. The most characteristic feature of the weather, however, is the summer fog, which lies low over the city until midday, creating consternation among shivering tourists. This fog is a phenomenon of temperature contrasts, created when warm, moist ocean air comes in contact with cold water welling up from the ocean bottom along the coast.[P9]Fog enveloping the Golden Gate Bridge, which spans the entrance to San Francisco Bay in northern California.© MedioImages/Getty Images[ML9] City layout The central business district, the financial district, North Beach, and Chinatown occupy the site of the gold-rush city, which subsequently was expanded by progressive fillings along the waterfront. The remnants of many ships that were deserted in 1849 now lie under office buildings several blocks inland. To the west, at the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge, lies the Presidio, a two-century-old military installation that became part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1994; it is remarkable for its parklike lawns and wind-sculptured stands of trees. South of the Presidio is Golden Gate Park, reclaimed from a onetime sandy desert. The rest of San Francisco is largely composed of residential neighbourhoods, from Pacific Heights, in which the old, wealthy families reside, to Hunters Point, which is predominantly an African American community. Most are filled with flower-decked houses of pastel stucco and “painted ladies”—frame structures with abundant and often elegant architectural detailing, intricately coloured.[P10]San Francisco.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.“Painted ladies,” Victorian homes with richly coloured architectural detailing, San Francisco.© MedioImages/Getty Images[ML10] A great change, which has been described as the Manhattanization of San Francisco, became apparent after the late 1960s, and it has been both welcomed and resisted. In the financial district, in particular, one tall building after another has been constructed in a city in which, for generations, few structures were higher than 20 stories. Among the modern skyscrapers are 555 California Street (formerly known as the Bank of America building), the Transamerica Pyramid (which rises to an elongated point), and the Le Méridien San Francisco hotel (formerly the Park Hyatt). The Hyatt Regency is part of the massive Embarcadero Center complex—designed by John Portman in the 1970s—which encompasses six city blocks and houses numerous shops, hotels, and restaurants.[P11]San FranciscoSan Francisco.Larry Brownstein/Getty Images[ML11] Another concern is one that San Francisco shares with few other U.S. cities—destruction by earthquake. Severe quakes have been felt in 1868, 1898, 1900, 1906, and 1989. But it was the 1906 earthquake that did the most damage and that has become identified with the city. A little after 5:00 am on April 18 the entire city began to tremble and shake. There was a terrible noise, “like the roar of 10,000 lions,” and San Franciscans knew they were experiencing a nightmarish earthquake. Cable cars jerked to a stop and the $7 million City Hall crumbled like a movie set. The glass roof over the Palace Hotel court splintered and rained down shards.[P12]Crowds watching the fires set off by the earthquake in San Francisco in 1906, photo by Arnold Genthe.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.Aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906.U.S. Department of Defense[ML12] That quake was followed by a massive fire that destroyed the centre of town and burned for four days, until the smouldering ashes were wetted down by rain. Starting in the business section near Montgomery Street and the South of Market district, the inferno swept toward Russian Hill, Chinatown, North Beach, and Telegraph Hill, where Italians poured wine on the flames to save their houses. Gone were 4 square miles (10 square km), making up 512 blocks in the centre of town, along with 28,000 buildings and a total property value of about $350 million. It was originally thought that some 700 people died, though the death toll is now believed to be more than 3,000. In addition, 250,000 were left homeless, and survivors camped in Golden Gate Park. An Eastern journalist, celebrating the survival of a local distillery, composed the verse, “If, as some say, God spanked the town / For being over frisky, / Why did he burn the Churches down / And save Hotaling’s Whisky?”[P13]San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake.Library of Congress Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division, Washington, D.C.[ML13] Since the 1906 earthquake, seismologists and engineers have warned that it could happen again. Several relatively strong earthquakes (measuring more than 5.0 on the Richter scale) have since then caused little damage. But the quake on October 17, 1989, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed more than 60 people and caused severe damage to the Marina District and to some freeways and even more devastation to surrounding areas. Modern office towers were largely unaffected, indicating that new building methods may provide some protection for the city.[P14]Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989: soil liquefactionAn automobile crushed under the remains of an apartment building in the Marina District, San Francisco, California.

Meyer/U.S. Geological Survey[ML14] [H4]People The pattern of immigration into San Francisco during the latter half of the 19th century was significantly different from that of anywhere else in the United States. The waves of newcomers included not only native-born Americans moving west but also Europeans arriving directly by ship who had not previously lived for a time along the Eastern Seaboard. The demography of the gold-rush city was summed up concisely by a real-estate firm that advertised it could “transact business in the English, French, German, Spanish and Italian languages.” San Francisco remains one of the most Mediterranean of American cities—New Orleans is another—and Italians are still the dominant European minority, followed by Germans, Irish, and British.[P15] Jewish immigrants from Europe arrived in the city even before the gold seekers of 1849, and much credit for San Francisco’s culture must be given to them. They founded libraries, symphonies, and theatres and gave the city its first aura of sophistication.[P16] Before World War II about 20,000 African Americans lived in the entire Bay Area, about 4,000 of them in San Francisco. The tremendous increase in the black population during the next 30 years was set in motion by the war, which brought at least a half million war workers to the Bay Area’s shipyards and other industries. Among them were tens of thousands from the South, who settled mainly in San Francisco, Oakland, and Richmond. In San Francisco they moved into the old Carpenter Gothic houses in the blocks around Fillmore Street, vacated when the Japanese who had lived there were driven into wartime internment camps. By the 1980s, the character of the district shifted again, as the renovation of these houses and the high cost of property caused rents to skyrocket. Poorer African American residents were forced out of their neighbourhoods and into slum housing in the city’s already crowded southeastern sector.[P17] An increasing number of African Americans have become prominent in the city’s life—Willie Brown was elected mayor in 1995 and reelected in 1999—and many others also have won elective office.[P18] Chinatown, which is the best-known Chinese community in the United States, is also probably the least understood minority community in the city. The colourful shops and restaurants of Grant Avenue mask a slum of crowded tenements and sweatshops that has the highest population density in an already densely populated city. Many Chinese residents have increasingly moved into North Beach, hitherto predominantly Italian, onto the nearby slopes of Russian Hill, or into the middle-class neighbourhoods of the Richmond district north of Golden Gate Park, where some of the city’s most popular Chinese restaurants and bakeries are found on Clement Street. Many of those who reside in Chinatown are more recent immigrants, particularly from Hong Kong.[P19]San Francisco: ChinatownLanterns hanging in Chinatown, San Francisco.trekandshoot—iStock/Thinkstock[ML19] Never as large as Chinatown, the Japanese community of San Francisco was wiped out at a single stroke by the infamous Executive Order 9066 of 1942, which sent them, foreign-born and citizen alike, into “relocation centres.” The present centre of the Japanese community is Japantown (Nihonmachi), a few blocks east of Fillmore Street, now an ambitious commercial and cultural centre. Though the rising generation of Japanese Americans go to Japantown as visitors, bound for church services, social or cultural events (such as the annual cherry blossom festival), or to buy imported goods, their own roots are elsewhere.[P20] The Spanish-speaking population is the second largest ethnic minority in the city (the Chinese community being the first). Before World War II the Mission District, named for the Mission Dolores, was principally working class and Irish. The Irish were largely replaced by Spanish-speaking Latin American immigrants, mainly from Central America and Mexico. Living among them are pockets of Native Americans and Samoans.[P21] The Filipino community has grown remarkably since World War II and has spread to all areas of the city, especially the South of Market area. Though not as numerous as in Southern California, the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian communities have grown considerably since the 1980s, which resulted in conflicts with blacks and Hispanics over low-income housing and a proliferation of ethnic restaurants in the troubled Tenderloin area between the Civic Center and Union Square.[P22] San Franciscans have historically considered their city to be laissez-faire and open-minded, which is probably why homosexuals have felt comfortable there. The affluent Castro district (technically Eureka Valley near Twin Peaks) has attracted gays and lesbians from throughout the country, becoming perhaps the most famous gay neighbourhood in the world. Its streets are adorned with elegantly restored Victorian homes and landmarks highlighting significant dates in the struggle for gay rights. It is said that no local politician can win an election without the gay community’s vote.[P23] [H5]Economy The gold rush (1848–49) established San Francisco as the premier city of the West, known from the Oregon border to the pueblo of Los Angeles simply as the City. It is still a great port, the financial and administrative capital of the West, and a substantial centre for commerce and manufacturing.[P24] A large portion of the city’s employed work in the area of finance. Other leading areas of employment include business services (personnel supply, building maintenance, security, computers and data processing, and advertising), retail trade, the tourist and convention industry, and professional services. Many companies, such as Levi Strauss & Co., producer of one of San Francisco’s most famous products, blue jeans, have located their national headquarters in the Bay Area.[P25] Port From its beginnings as a port of call in the hide-and-tallow trade and, later, as the home port of the Pacific whale fishery, San Francisco has been acutely conscious of the importance of shipping. In the 19th century ships stopped there from their trip around Cape Horn or the Isthmus of Panama, and “steamer day” was a civic institution; after 1914 cargo and passenger vessels arrived from the East by way of the Panama Canal. In 1867 the Pacific Mail Steamship Company opened the first transpacific service, sailing from San Francisco to Yokohama (Japan) and Hong Kong. Imports and exports now passing through the San Francisco Customs District make the combined ports of San Francisco Bay—San Francisco, Oakland, Alameda, Sacramento, and Stockton—one of the most active international ports in the country.[P26] Industry and tourism Manufacturing is the main source of income in the Bay Area. In San Francisco, in which manufacturing is a lesser source of income, the principal industries are apparel and other textile products, food processing, and shipbuilding, while the aerospace and electronics industries are strong in the cities of the peninsula. Of note is Silicon Valley, a region just south of the bay that is the heart of the nation’s computer industry.[P27] Tourism is a major source of income. The bridges, Coit Tower, the museums, the restaurants, Chinatown, North Beach, the Victorian mansions, crooked Lombard Street, and the dazzling Fairmont Hotel are major attractions; Fisherman’s Wharf, however, is the most popular. Families browse the area, watching fishermen prepare the crab catch and mend their nets amid dozens of souvenir shops, street entertainers, restaurants, and bakeries selling one of the city’s specialties, sourdough bread. Getting to Fisherman’s Wharf on the Powell-Hyde Street cable car is a popular route.[P28]San FranciscoSan Francisco, with Coit Tower in the background.© MedioImages/Getty ImagesBoats docked at Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML28] San Francisco’s waterfront offers whale-watching excursions, provides a boat tour from the wharf to Alcatraz Island, and is home to Ghirardelli Square, the onetime chocolate factory; the Cannery, built for the California Fruit Canners Association (now Del Monte Corporation) in 1907, and now a marketplace; Pier 39, reconstructed using timbers from old ships to create a New England look, home to shops and eateries and one of the best seal-watching spots on the coast; and the Anchorage, which has a mini-amphitheatre. Nearby is the Marina District, formerly known as Harbor View when its natural amphitheatre was the scene of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition.[P29]Beach near Lands End, San Francisco.© William Lee[ML29] Finance A financial centre since the first pinch of gold dust was exchanged for cash, San Francisco is the seat of the Pacific Stock Exchange as well as the headquarters of many banks and other financial services companies, among them Wells Fargo. Though there are no native, independent banks headquartered in San Francisco, the city still ranks among the nation’s largest investment banking centres.[P30] Transportation Periodic smog, produced mainly by the automobiles in the area, is a serious concern. Freeway traffic is also a problem, as travel from the East Bay cities of Oakland and Berkeley and from Marin county to the north is confined to two great but overburdened bridges. The world’s longest high-level steel bridge, the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, is 4.5 miles (7.2 km) long; it was completed in 1936 and consists of two back-to-back suspension bridges, a connecting tunnel on Yerba Buena Island, five truss spans, and a cantilever span. The orange-red Golden Gate Bridge, leading north to Marin county, was completed in 1937. It is a pure suspension bridge with a 4,200-foot (1,280-metre) centre span; the spectacular clear span was the longest in the world until 1964 when New York City’s Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened. At its highest point the bridge is about 260 feet (80 metres) above the bay.[P31]San Francisco: Golden Gate BridgeGolden Gate Bridge, San Francisco.© Mariusz Blach/Fotolia[ML31] Until the ferries were doomed by the bridges, San Francisco was served by a great network of ferry routes, whose splendid vessels were said to deliver more passengers to the Ferry Building at the foot of Market Street than arrived at any other transportation depot except Charing Cross railway station in London. Only after the bridges began to choke with traffic did the ferries return, on a smaller scale, between San Francisco and Marin county.[P32] A much greater undertaking was the interurban rapid-transit system known as BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit), which began operating in 1972. With service between San Francisco and the East Bay communities through an underwater tube more than 3.6 miles (5.8 km) long, BART was the first system of its sort—part subway and part elevated—to be built in half a century. These comfortable, computerized automatic trains run at speeds as high as 80 miles (130 km) per hour.[P33] San Francisco, situated at the head of a peninsula, has always been a dead end for rail traffic. Beginning with the arrival of the first westbound train over the tracks of the Central Pacific on September 6, 1869, transcontinental trains began discharging their passengers in Oakland, where ferries or buses carried them to San Francisco. As in the rest of the country, the railroad’s importance as a passenger carrier declined after World War II.[P34] The instantly recognizable symbol of San Francisco is the beloved cable car. Invented by Andrew Hallidie (because he felt sorry for the dray horses that were often injured on the steep hills), the system was tested in 1873 and soon adopted by other cities. By the 1880s, cities such as Chicago, Kansas City (Missouri), and Los Angeles had variations of Hallidie’s creation. The other cities eventually abandoned cable cars, but San Francisco has stubbornly clung to the picturesque if archaic, and sometimes dangerous, means of negotiating the hills. Rudyard Kipling was awed by the concept:[P35]San Francisco: cable carCable car in San Francisco. © Efaah0/Dreamstime.com[ML35] I gave up asking questions about their mechanism.…If it pleases Providence to make a car run up and down a slit in the ground for many miles, and if for two-pence-hapenny I can ride in that car, why should I seek reasons for that miracle? Before the 1906 earthquake 600 cars covered 110 miles (177 km) of the city, but the system was devastated by the quake and much of it was not restored. Today more than two dozen cars operate at peak hours, carrying about 25,000 people daily to limited destinations via three lines.[P37] San Francisco International Airport is located about 7 miles (11 km) south of the city-county limits, occupying a filled site on the southwestern shore of the bay.[P38] Page 1 of 2 Next page Administration and social conditions

California"San Jose"City"Santa Clara county"west-central California"San Jose, city, seat (1850) of Santa Clara county, west-central California, U.S. It lies in the Santa Clara Valley along Coyote Creek and the Guadalupe River, about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of San Francisco. The city, located just southeast of San Francisco Bay, sprawls over a broad floodplain that gradually slopes upward toward more rugged terrain to the east and south. With its semiarid climate, San Jose is known for its sunny, mild weather.[P1]San Jose State University, CaliforniaTower Hall and Morris Dailey Auditorium, San Jose State University, San Jose, California.John Pozniak[ML1]San Jose, the third largest city in California, is also the most populous component of the extensive metropolitan area around the bay that, in addition to San Francisco, includes Oakland.

The first civic settlement in California, it was founded by José Joaquin Moraga in 1777 as a Spanish farming community and was named Pueblo de San José de Guadalupé for St. Joseph (San José). During the Spanish colonial and Mexican periods, it supplied wheat, vegetables, and cattle to the military garrisons at Monterey and San Francisco. After the American occupation of California in 1846, San Jose briefly became the new state’s first capital, and the first state legislative assembly convened there in December 1849. (The state capital was moved to Vallejo in 1852 and, permanently, to Sacramento in 1854.) In March 1850 San Jose became the first chartered city in California, by which time it had become a bustling trade depot for the goldfields east of Sacramento. In 1864 the coming of the railroad from San Francisco gave San Jose improved trade connections and enabled the produce of nearby farms to be readily shipped to San Francisco. The Santa Clara Valley thus soon developed into a region of orchards and fruit processing.[P3] Until 1940 most of the city’s industries remained centred on food processing and the manufacture of orchard supplies and agricultural equipment. During and after World War II, however, there was a meteoric growth in the manufacture of such durable goods as electrical machinery, aircraft parts, and motor vehicles. Large aerospace and business-equipment firms located plants in the area, and San Jose’s rise as the anchor of Silicon Valley produced an even more spectacular burst of growth for the city that only increased with the boom in Internet-related industries in the 1990s. The city annexed land at a rapid rate, more than tripling its area between 1960 and 2000; during that same period its population more than quadrupled. The citizenry has long been ethnically diverse, with large and growing Asian and Hispanic communities that combined now constitute some three-fifths of the total population.[P4] [H3]The contemporary city San Jose’s economy remains heavily focused on high technology. Computer hardware design and manufacturing, software production, and Internet concerns are its major industries. Electronic equipment, semiconductors, scientific instruments, and industrial machinery are produced, and business, health, and engineering services are other important economic factors. The Santa Clara Valley continues to be a productive agricultural area. Major crops include greenhouse plants, cut flowers, mushrooms, and an array of fruits and vegetables (notably wine grapes, cherries, peppers, tomatoes, and lettuce); beef cattle are also raised.[P5] The city is home to San Jose State University (1857; part of the California State University system) and San Jose City College (1921); Santa Clara and Stanford universities are nearby. San Jose supports a variety of music, dance, and theatre organizations, including professional ballet and opera companies. Notable museums include the San Jose Museum of Art and the Tech Museum of Innovation. Rosicrucian Park has a museum of Egyptian antiquities and a planetarium and science centre. The Winchester Mystery House, a 160-room Victorian mansion filled with unusual architectural features, was under construction continuously between 1884 and 1922 by the eccentric widow Sarah Winchester, heir to the fortune of the firearms-manufacturing company. It is maintained as a museum, as are Peralta Adobe (1797), the last remaining structure from the original pueblo, and nearby Fallon House (1855), built for one of the city’s first mayors.[P6] There is an extensive system of municipal and regional parks. Kelley Park, along Coyote Creek, includes a zoo, a Japanese garden, and an outdoor historic museum of restored and replicated buildings from San Jose’s early years. The 720-acre (290-hectare) Alum Rock Park (1872), on the eastern edge of the city, is California’s oldest municipal park. The city abounds in flower gardens, notably the Municipal Rose Garden and Overfelt Gardens. San Jose is home to the Sharks, the Bay Area’s professional ice hockey team. Several state parks are in the vicinity, including Henry W. Coe (southeast) and Big Basin Redwoods (southwest).

California"San Juan Capistrano"City"Orange county"southern California"San Juan Capistrano, city, Orange county, southern California, U.S. Located near the Pacific coast, it lies halfway between San Diego and Los Angeles. The seventh in the California chain of 21 Franciscan missions, Mission San Juan Capistrano was founded in 1776 by Father Junípero Serra and named for the Neapolitan crusader Saint John of Capistrano. The mission was constructed 1797–1806 and was badly damaged in 1812 by an earthquake that wrecked its cruciform church and killed 29 people. The church remains a crumbled ruin with arches, quadrangle, and garden; there has, however, been some restoration of the mission buildings, including the adobe Serra Chapel (still in use). Settlement grew up around the mission, which has gained fame through its swallows, which reputedly fly off on St. John’s Day (October 23) and return “miraculously” to their mission nests on St. Joseph’s Day (March 19). Their departure and return are celebrated by fiestas. The city is populated in part by descendants of early Spanish, Mexican, and Indian settlers; it experienced significant residential development during the last decades of the 20th century.

The region was explored by the Spanish in the 1770s. Once part of the Mexican land grants Ranchos San Leandro (1839) and San Antonio (1820), San Leandro was known as Squatterville when prospectors settled there after the 1849 Gold Rush. Laid out in 1855, it began as a horticultural centre and was the county seat until 1872; though agriculture has given way to services and warehousing, the city still celebrates an annual cherry festival (first held in 1909).

California"San Luis Obispo"City"San Luis Obispo county"western California"San Luis Obispo, city, seat (1850) of San Luis Obispo county, western California, U.S. It lies on San Luis Obispo Creek at the base of the Santa Lucia Mountains, 20 miles (30 km) east of the Pacific Ocean and 80 miles (130 km) northwest of the city of Santa Barbara. It grew up as a farming centre around the mission of San Luis Obispo de Tolosa (for St. Louis, bishop of Toulouse), founded in 1772 by Junípero Serra as the fifth in the California chain of 21 missions. San Luis Obispo came under U.S. control in 1846. During the lawless and violent Gold Rush period, much of the land continued to be held by Mexicans, who established an economy largely based on the hides and tallow industry. In the 1860s severe drought destroyed much of the rancho land. The Mexican ranchers subsequently sold many of their holdings, and the area became a centre for beef- and dairy-cattle production. After 1894 it became a railroad division point. Oil, pumped and refined locally, is shipped through Port San Luis, located along the Pacific coast 9 miles (14 km) southwest of the city. Light manufacturing, wineries (located throughout the county), and tourism are other economic factors. It is the home of California Polytechnic State University (1901) and Cuesta (community) College (1963). The city’s attractions include children’s and county museums.

Sheltered by hills from ocean wind and fog, San Mateo enjoys a mild maritime climate.[P1]San Mateo: Japanese tea garden Japanese tea garden in Central Park, San Mateo, California.Daderot[ML1]The area was first inhabited by Ohlone Indians. A Spanish exploring party (1776) named a creek at the site after St. Matthew, and in 1793 a Spanish mission hospice was established along the creek. After Mexican independence the area was divided between two land grants, Rancho San Mateo and Rancho de Las Pulgas, parts of each of which lie in the modern city. Eventually the ranchos were sold, and in the 1850s an American village grew up there surrounded by farms. After the locality was connected by rail with San Francisco in 1863, men who had amassed fortunes during the Gold Rush bought up farms there to establish their country “estates,” which were gradually subdivided to house a growing number of commuters to San Francisco. In the second half of the 20th century, the proportion of commuters in the population declined because of the growth of San Mateo’s own job base, largely in retail commerce and light industry.[P2]In the 1960s San Mateo began to take on a metropolitan appearance, with a cluster of multistory buildings in the downtown area. Its shopping centres and business offices continue to serve the surrounding area. The (community) College of San Mateo was founded in 1922, and the city is also the site of the Bay Meadows Race Track and the San Mateo County Expo Center.

Laid out in 1882 and incorporated as a city in 1888, San Pedro, despite its shallow waters, soon became a port. After it was annexed with adjacent Wilmington (originally New San Pedro) by Los Angeles in 1909, work began in earnest to deepen and transform its roadstead by dredging into one of the world’s largest man-made harbours. Breakwaters were extended and terminals built, and modern port facilities now handle much of the harbour commerce. Along its waterfront are shipyards, dry docks, fish canneries, and oil refineries, as well as a memorial to the merchant marines. Los Angeles Air Force Base and Cabrillo Beach (with a notable marine aquarium) are on Point Fermin at the peninsula’s southern tip. Also on Point Fermin is Fort MacArthur, once an extensive military reservation; part of it now supports the Los Angeles air base, and it houses a museum with exhibits on Los Angeles’s harbour defenses and the role of Los Angeles during wartime.

The original settlement grew around the Mission Santa Clara de Asís, which was founded in 1777 and was the eighth in the California chain of 21 missions. The Spanish historical influence is evident in the city’s place-names, architecture, and restored mission. The city developed as a processing centre for the prunes, apricots, and other fruits and vegetables grown in the rich Santa Clara Valley. By the 1940s, however, manufacturing had surpassed agriculture in importance, and since then Santa Clara’s growth has reflected a mixed economy with a growing service sector.

The Spaniards built an agricultural outpost in the valley in the early 19th century, and eventually the territory became part of the Rancho San Francisco land grant to Antonio del Valle in 1839. Del Valle developed the area into a cattle- and sheep-ranching centre, but the economy was devastated in the 1860s by a severe drought. The discovery of gold in the valley in 1842 brought numerous prospectors, though production dwindled by the end of the decade. Oil became an important industry, and California’s first refinery was built there in 1876. Also in 1876, the railway connected the valley with Los Angeles and San Francisco. Communities in the valley subsequently sprung up and were punctuated by saloons and railroad shops. With the advent of the movie industry, westerns began to be filmed in the area; film star William S. Hart built an estate there, and later singer-actor Gene Autry’s ranch was the site of numerous movies and television series.

The name Sonoma comes from a Wintun Indian word for “nose,” probably derived from a local Indian chief and tribe. Vallejo’s home (1850) and the restored mission now form the main part of Sonoma State Historic Park. On June 14, 1846, a small band of American settlers invaded Sonoma and captured Vallejo and his Mexican military garrison. They raised the improvised Bear Flag of California (designed by William Todd, nephew of Mary Todd Lincoln) and declared a republic, which lasted until July 9. In the 1850s a Hungarian count, Agoston Haraszthy, planted thousands of cuttings from European grape vines around his Buena Vista vineyard (east of the city) and laid the foundation for the vast California wine industry. Wine making, diversified farming, and tourism (particularly in relation to its wineries and vineyards) are the city’s economic mainstays. Inc. 1881. Pop.

California"South San Francisco"City"San Mateo county"western California"South San Francisco, city, San Mateo county, western California, U.S. Situated at the southern base of San Bruno Mountain, it lies about 3 miles (5 km) south of San Francisco on U.S. Highway 101 Bypass. The area was formerly part of Rancho Buriburi, a Mexican land grant designated in 1835. Much of the land was eventually bought by Henry Miller and Charles Lux, who built a large estate there. Peter Iler subsequently purchased the land, and the city was laid out in 1890. South San Francisco subsequently became heavily industrialized, with meatpacking, steel and other metal fabrication, chemical processing, and other manufacturing. The city has since become a centre of the biotechnology industry, which includes Genentech (founded 1976). South San Francisco boasts an attractive residential section with a view of San Francisco Bay. The most visible city attraction is a large sign, constructed in 1923, that reads “South San Francisco The Industrial City,” located on Sign Hill.

California"Stockton"City"San Joaquin county"north-central California"Stockton, city, seat (1850) of San Joaquin county, north-central California, U.S. It lies along the San Joaquin River, 40 miles (65 km) south of Sacramento. Connected westward with San Francisco Bay by the river’s 78-mile (126-km) channel, Stockton is, with Sacramento, one of the state’s two inland ports. Part of Rancho del Campo de Los Franceses, a Mexican land grant (1844) to William Gulnac, it was later purchased by Captain Charles Weber, who founded the city of Tuleburg in 1849. Because it was the head of navigation on the river, the city grew rapidly as a miners’ supply point during the 1849 Gold Rush. In 1850 the city was renamed to honour Commodore Robert F. Stockton, who in 1846 had claimed California for the United States; Stockton was the first incorporated city in California to bear a name that is not of Spanish or American Indian origin.[P1]StocktonCity centre of Stockton, California.© Terrance Emerson/Shutterstock.com[ML1]Stockton’s growth as a market for mixed farm produce and wines of the Central Valley was assured by the introduction of irrigation and the arrival of the Central Pacific Railroad (1869). The river’s deepwater channel (completed 1933) made it a major port as well as a supply depot for U.S. Pacific military operations. Although Stockton remains a leading centre of fruit, vegetable, and wine production, its agricultural base is now strongly augmented by diversified industry.[P2]The University of the Pacific (founded 1851 in Santa Clara) was moved to Stockton in 1923. Humphreys College was established in 1896, and San Joaquin Delta (community) College was opened in 1935.

California"Susanville"City"Lassen county"northeastern California"Susanville, city, seat (1864) of Lassen county, northeastern California, U.S. It lies on the Susan River, at the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada, at the head of the Honey Lake Valley, 85 miles (137 km) northwest of Reno, Nevada. In 1853 Isaac Roop staked a claim and built a cabin on the site. The following year Peter Lassen and a group of prospectors joined him; they struck gold, and the settlement, later named for Roop’s daughter, became a bustling mining town. In 1856 Roop established the short-lived “republic” of Nataqua and made Susanville its capital. The city is now a marketing and shipping centre for an agricultural area (dairy products and grain) and has lumber and flour mills; Diamond Mountain Casino, operated by the Susanville Indian Rancheria, contributes to the local economy. Susanville contains a community college established in 1925 and is a gateway to Lassen Volcanic National Park and Lassen National Forest (headquartered at Susanville). Plumas National Forest is also nearby. Other recreational facilities are available at Eagle Lake, Honey Lake, and Lake Almanor. The Roop’s Fort/William Pratt Memorial Museum (1854) was the “capitol” building of the Nataqua republic, which, in an 1863 event known as the Sagebrush War, resisted California’s jurisdiction.

California"Thousand Oaks"City"Ventura county"southern California"Thousand Oaks, city, Ventura county, southern California, U.S. Situated in the Conejo (Spanish: “Rabbit”) Valley along the Ventura–Los Angeles county line, it lies 40 miles (60 km) west of Los Angeles. Originally inhabited by Chumash Indians, the area was reached in 1542 by the Spanish explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo. The area was largely unsettled until 1803, when soldiers José Polanco and Ignacio Rodriquez were ceded a Spanish land grant called Rancho El Conejo. In the 1870s the area became a stagecoach stop between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Throughout the 19th century, the original rancho lands were subdivided, and in 1910 Edwin and Harold Janss purchased about one-fifth of the original grant, which now forms the central part of the city. The area developed as an agricultural centre, with poultry and dairy farms and extensive apricot groves. Tourists were drawn to the area beginning in 1927, when Goebel’s Lion Farm (later called Jungleland; closed 1969) opened. The Janss Conejo Ranch later was used for the filming of many of the episodes of the television series Bonanza, and the city was the backdrop for several popular movies.[P1]High technology, particularly biotechnology and aerospace, and health care are economically important, and Thousand Oaks is home to many regional and corporate headquarters. The city contains the popular Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza (1994; the largest performing-arts centre between Los Angeles and San Francisco), the Stagecoach Inn Museum (originally built 1876), which features exhibits on the area’s history, Conejo Valley Art Museum (1978), and the Chumash Interpretive Center (1996). Thousand Oaks is the seat of California Lutheran University (1959). It is also known for its recreational areas, with more than 75 miles (120 km) of trails and some 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares) of natural open space.

Angered by long-standing social injustices, thousands of African Americans rioted, burned stores, and pillaged the area. Before order was restored, 34 people had been killed, nearly 4,000 arrested, and more than 1,000 injured, and hundreds of buildings had been destroyed. Disorder again marred the district in 1992 when rioting, looting, and arson consumed much of Watts and neighbouring Compton following the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of African American Rodney King. A notable local attraction is Watts Towers (now a state historic park and a national historic landmark), a group of 17 bricolage spires constructed from 1921 to 1954 by Italian immigrant Simon Rodia from broken tiles, dishes, rocks, bottles, and seashells; the tallest of the towers rises to nearly 100 feet (30 metres).[P1]Watts TowersWatts Towers in the Watts district of Los Angeles.BenFrantzDale[ML1] [END-OF-CONTENT]

Founded by prospectors c. 1878 and named for the local stands of aspen trees, it became a booming silver-mining town of 15,000 by 1887 but declined rapidly after silver prices collapsed in the early 1890s. Long forgotten and nearly a ghost town, Aspen has become one of the most desirable—and expensive—destinations in the United States. Aspen’s revival—as a recreational and cultural mecca—began in the late 1930s and was in large part due to the enterprise of Walter Paepcke, a Chicago industrialist. Nearby are some of the high points of the Rocky Mountains, including Capitol, Creek, Snowmass, and Maroon peaks (all exceeding 14,000 feet [4,270 metres]); the average snowfall on these peaks exceeds 300 inches (760 cm) per year. During World War II the city served as a training centre for mountain divisions of the U.S. Army, which further spurred the city’s development. The first ski-lift-assisted area was opened in the winter of 1946–47; Aspen’s subsequent development of facilities for skiing and other winter sports make it a popular winter resort. It has also become a vacation centre for the film industry, around which an internationally renowned film festival, inaugurated in 1979, has grown. Paepcke created the Aspen Institute (1950; formally the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies), which in turn established the Aspen Music Festival and School (1950); both are summer attractions.

Colorado"Boulder"City"Boulder county"north-central Colorado"Boulder, city, seat (1861) of Boulder county, north-central Colorado, U.S., on Boulder Creek, at the base of the Flatiron Range of the Rocky Mountains, at an elevation of 5,354 feet (1,632 metres), 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Denver. Settled by miners in 1858, it was organized in 1859 and named descriptively for nearby Boulder Canyon. With the arrival of two railroads in 1873, the town grew as the gateway to the mines in the mountains to the west and also as a farming centre; the establishment there of the University of Colorado (1876) sustained its growth. An extensive government-industrial-educational complex has developed since the early 1950s. Boulder has become a leading centre for scientific and environmental research. A key section of the National Bureau of Standards, the U.S. branch of the World Data Center of Solar Activity, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are located there, as are a growing number of industrial firms. The water supply is unique, coming partly from the city-owned Arapahoe Glacier high on the Continental Divide.[P1]BoulderMacky Auditorium on the campus of the University of Colorado, Boulder.MECU[ML1]Following a two-decade period of rapid expansion, Boulder took measures to curtail growth in the mid-1990s, limiting new housing permits and preserving open land while refurbishing older buildings in the city centre. Portions of the central city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Boulder remains a highly desirable location, with a thriving economy fueled by the development of high-technology manufacturing industries. Boulder is home to Naropa University (1974), a unique school that combines contemplative studies with traditional Western areas of scholarship, and also has a branch of Front Range Community College (founded in 1968 as Community College of Denver).[P2]Boulder Canyon and other canyons in the vicinity have great scenic beauty.

The present downtown preserves the character of the original city centre, and some 250 of its buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Mining continued until the mid-1940s, after which Breckenridge was largely depopulated. In the 1960s the mountains near Breckenridge became a favourite destination of alpine skiers, including Olympic athletes in training, and a resort industry grew to serve them; tourism is now the city’s economic mainstay.

Colorado"Canon City"City"Fremont county"south-central Colorado"Canon City, also spelled Cañon City, city, seat (1861) of Fremont county, south-central Colorado, U.S. It is located at the eastern end of the Royal Gorge of the Arkansas River between the Front Range and Wet Mountains, just north of a segment of San Isabel National Forest. The site (elevation 5,343 feet [1,629 metres]), formerly a camping ground of the Ute Indians and frequented by other groups, was settled by gold seekers in 1859. In the late 1860s oil was discovered nearby, and Canon City (from Spanish cañon, “canyon”) developed as a supply point for the nearby mines and oil field. In 1868 Canon City vied with Denver to become the site of the Colorado capital; after narrowly losing that contest, Canon City was awarded the territorial prison, now the Colorado State Penitentiary, established there in 1871. After the arrival of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railway in 1874, the community became a shipping point for agricultural products, livestock, minerals, quarried marble, and (later) manufactured items (firebrick, concrete, hand tools, conveyors, and ore concentrates). Much of the modern city’s economy revolves around correctional facilities, 10 of which are located nearby. Canon City is also a base for model rocket manufacturing.[P1]Canon CityRoyal Gorge Bridge, Canon City, Colo.Larry D.

Colorado"Central City"City"Gilpin county"north-central Colorado"Central City, city, seat (1861) of Gilpin county, north-central Colorado, U.S. It lies along North Fork of Clear Creek in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, 26 miles (42 km) west of Denver. A historic mining town on a rocky hillside along Gregory Gulch (elevation 8,560 feet [2,609 metres]), it originated soon after the first important gold lode was discovered there in 1859 by John H. Gregory. It became known as Central City because its central location made it the meeting place for miners in the region and the centre of supplies and mail for other mining camps. During its boom days in the 1860s it was known as the “richest square mile on earth”; its population reached 15,000, and for a few years it rivaled Denver as Colorado’s largest city. In 1874 a fire destroyed most of the wooden buildings in the city, including its ramshackle playhouses. Four years later a fine opera house was built of mountain stone. Central City languished with the drop in gold production, and by the 1930s it was almost a ghost town. The Central City Opera House, which even at its peak had not been a financial success, was renovated in 1932, and a summer festival was organized that continued to draw top opera and theatre performers into the 21st century. Mementos of Central City’s past are preserved in a reconstructed narrow-gauge railway (1867), the Teller House (1872), the Gilpin History Museum (1870; a two-story former schoolhouse), and other features. Because of the annual summer festival held in the Opera House, Central City is perhaps the best-known of all Colorado mining towns. After limited-stakes gambling was legalized in Central City in 1991, many casinos were built that changed the town’s character and attractions dramatically.

Much of the world’s supply of molybdenum (a steel-toughening alloy) was produced at the Climax Mine in nearby Bartlett Mountain; it became the largest underground mine of its kind in North America. Molybdenum was first discovered there in 1903 by gold prospectors who ignored it, thinking it was lead. The metal was subsequently identified by the Colorado School of Mines, and later, when its value was recognized, a worldwide demand ensued. Climax thus became one of Colorado’s most prosperous mining towns. The mine was still operational at the end of the 1990s, although at levels far below the daily production of more than 43,500 tonnes of molybdenum at the height of the mining boom. Pyrites, monazites, tin, and tungsten concentrates are recovered from the mill tailings.[P1]Climax: molybdenum mineMolybdenum mine, Climax, Colorado, c. 1940s.Farm Security Administration–Office of War Information Photograph Collection/Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.

Founded in 1871 as Fountain Colony by General William J. Palmer, builder of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, it was renamed for the nearby Manitou mineral springs. Growth of the area followed the Cripple Creek gold strikes in the 1890s and the promotion of tourism related to the health-resort trade. In 1917 Colorado Springs consolidated with Colorado City (founded 1859 as El Dorado City). The establishment of military installations gave further impetus to development.[P1]View of downtown Colorado Springs, Colo.Colorado Springs Convention and Visitors Bureau[ML1]The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the U.S. Space Command are headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base (1942). The hollowed-out interior of nearby Cheyenne Mountain houses the command and control facilities of NORAD and of other agencies; since 1966 it has been a primary base for aerospace defense and for the tracking of orbiting objects. Fort Carson (1942) is on the city’s southern edge, while the U.S. Air Force Academy (1958) is set against a backdrop of the Rampart Range.[P2]Like other cities along the Front Range, Colorado Springs experienced tremendous growth in the 1980s and 1990s. Within a span of seven years (1990–97), the population of Colorado Springs increased from about 280,000 to more than 330,000, and much of the city’s large (186 square miles [482 square km]), formerly open, incorporated area was developed during this time.[P3]The city is the site of Colorado College (1874), the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (1965), and Nazarene Bible College (1967) and is well served by rail, road, and air links. The Garden of the Gods, a 1,350-acre (546-hectare) natural park with red sandstone monoliths, now a National Landmark, is one of many scenic attractions in the area.

The Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi), an early Pueblo culture, were the first known inhabitants of the region. After their mysterious disappearance about 1300 ce, the Ute, Navajo, and Arapaho peoples settled the area. The city of Cortez, named for Hernán Cortés (the Spanish conqueror of Mexico), was laid out by the Montezuma Valley Irrigation Company in 1886 on the site of a Navajo Indian seasonal camp called Tseyetoh (Navajo: “Water Rock”). The company also built a diversion canal from the Dolores River to the town centre. This canal enabled agriculture and the raising of livestock. These two activities provided the economic base of the community until the mid-1950s, after which oil and tourism grew in economic importance. Mining (uranium, vanadium, gold, silver, lead, zinc) and manufacturing (animal feeds, plywood, processed foods, leather goods, furniture, industrial gases) supplement the economy.[P1]The Cortez Center, operated by the city of Cortez in association with the University of Colorado, offers interpretive exhibits on the prehistory and history of the Mancos Valley region. Near the city are Yucca House National Monument (archaeological remains), Mesa Verde National Park, Ute Mountain Indian Reservation (including Ute Mountain Tribal Park, a 125,000-acre [50,585-hectare] archaeological preserve), San Juan National Forest, and the Four Corners Monument, where borders of four states (Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah) touch.

In 1891 gold was discovered in nearby Poverty Gulch by Robert Womack, a cowboy (who died poor), and in nearby Victor by Winfield Scott Stratton, a carpenter (who left a fortune of $20,000,000). Three railways reached Cripple Creek (whose name is of obscure origin) between 1893 and 1901.[P1]Cripple CreekCripple Creek, Colo.© Erik Patton/Shutterstock.com[ML1]Disasters that early plagued the city included a devastating fire (1894) and labour disputes (1903–04) that resulted in violence and loss of life. After 1920 gold production declined and Cripple Creek became almost a ghost town. By 1960 the population (which had risen to 50,000 in 1901) had declined to fewer than 1,000. Tourism is now the city’s economic mainstay, supplemented by a small amount of gold production (about 230,000 ounces a year in the late 1990s) and more than 20 casinos.

Colorado"Denver"City"city and county"at the western edge of the Great Plains"Denver, city and county, capital of Colorado, U.S., at the western edge of the Great Plains, just east of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The city and county were consolidated as a single administrative unit in 1902. Denver lies at the junction of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River; its elevation (5,280 feet [1,609 metres] above sea level at the State Capitol), which gives it the nickname “Mile High City,” and a mild, sunny, dry climate are distinctive characteristics. Metropolitan growth after World War II created a ring of suburban communities, including Arvada, Aurora, Brighton, Broomfield, Cherry Hills Village, Englewood, Lakewood, Littleton, Northglenn, Thornton, Westminster, and Wheat Ridge; Golden, about 12 miles (19 km) west of Denver, and Boulder, about 25 miles (40 km) northwest, are also part of the metropolitan region. Greater Denver is at the centre of a string of urban areas that stretches along the Front Range from Fort Collins in the north to Pueblo in the south.[P1]Skyline of Denver, Colo.© RondaKimbrow/iStock.comA discussion of Colorado's history, from the documentary Crossroads of Culture: The Colorado History Museum.Great Museums Television[ML1]Inc. 1885.

With the discovery of gold in June 1858, the rival towns of Auraria and St. Charles were founded on opposite sides of Cherry Creek. The claim of St. Charles was soon jumped by William Larimer, Jr., who in November 1858 renamed it Denver City for James W. Denver, governor of the Kansas Territory, of which the city was then a part. The site grew during the 1859 “Pikes Peak or bust” gold rush. Denver City and Auraria consolidated in 1860; the following year Colorado Territory was established and Denver City became Denver.[P3] The city was devastated by fire in 1863, and a year later a flash flood swept away many buildings, including the city hall. Uprisings by Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians on the plains in the 1860s resulted in their forced removal from Colorado. Denver became the territorial capital in 1867. When the transcontinental railway was built through Wyoming, Denver’s citizens organized their own railway, completed in 1870, to connect with the Union Pacific at Cheyenne; the Kansas Pacific Railroad reached Denver shortly thereafter. The resulting economic boom increased the population from 4,759 in 1870 to 106,713 in 1890.[P4] During the 1870s and ’80s, silver became more important economically than gold. Mining fortunes were created almost overnight, and an opera house was built. This period of opulence ended in 1893 with the crash of the silver markets. Banks failed, smelters shut down, and silver kings became paupers. New gold discoveries helped prevent a major decline, and farming, cattle and sheep ranching, and tourism began to provide a more stable economy. Railroads brought in sugar beets, wheat, cattle, and hogs, and Denver became a food processing centre. This industry was supported by waves of immigrants, including German brewers.[P5] Military activities—defense contractors and other facilities related to the Cold War—contributed to an economic boom after World War II, but most of these activities ended in the 1990s. Another boost came with soaring oil production in the 1970s, and high-rise office buildings were constructed throughout the city. However, Denver’s population began declining after reaching a peak in about 1970, and a crash in oil prices in the mid-1980s led to economic bust. Increasing population and the growth of tourism brought back prosperity in the 1990s, the city’s population surpassing its 1970 level by 2000.[P6] [H3]The contemporary city The present-day Denver metropolitan area spreads well into the foothills to the west of the city and the high plains surrounding it on the other three sides. In addition, Boulder, home of the main campus of the University of Colorado, is now linked to the metropolis by a nearly continuous built-up suburban corridor. People of European descent constitute the majority of Denver’s population, but those of Hispanic ancestry (particularly Mexican) comprise an increasing one-third of its residents; a relatively small proportion (about one-tenth) are African Americans, with even smaller numbers of Asians and Native Americans.[P7] The region’s rapid growth since 1950 has increased the strain on its infrastructure, especially water and transportation systems. The bulk of Denver’s water supply comes from spring snowmelt in the mountains that is stored in large reservoirs or diverted from the South Platte River and other streams. During periods of drought it is sometimes necessary to restrict water usage. The vast majority of Denverites rely on automobiles for transportation, and traffic congestion and pollution from auto emissions are chronic problems; at times, residents’ views of the mountains are obscured by smog. One approach to reducing automobile use has been to construct a light-rail transit system, the first line of which opened in 1994.[P8] As the largest city of a vast region between the Missouri River and the Pacific states, Denver serves as a transportation, industrial, and commercial hub and is a centre of high-technology industries. Major businesses include telecommunications, aviation and aerospace, software, financial and business services, and health care. Tourism is a primary economic factor. Manufactures include electronics, computer equipment, rubber products, luggage, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and packaging, and a large brewery is in nearby Golden. The Denver branch of the U.S. Mint (opened as a mint in 1906) produces about half of circulating U.S. coinage and is the nation’s second largest gold depository. Denver International Airport, one of the country’s largest, opened in 1995 and is located about 23 miles (37 km) northwest of the city.[P9] The city is the seat of the University of Denver (1864), Regis University (1877), Iliff School of Theology (1892), Metropolitan State University of Denver (1965), and a branch campus and the Health Sciences Center of the University of Colorado. The State Capitol (built 1887–95 in Corinthian style) has a 272-foot (83-metre) gold-leafed dome, and Civic Center Park adjoins the Capitol grounds. Denver’s climate and geographical location make outdoor recreation an especially popular pastime. The Rocky Mountains begin a few miles west of the city and provide opportunities for skiing, hiking, and mountain biking. Many ski areas are located within easy driving distance, including Winter Park Resort, which is part of the city’s park system; rafting on nearby Clear Creek and the Arkansas River farther to the southwest is popular in warmer weather. Bicycle paths are also laid out across the city itself. The Denver Mountain Parks, in addition to the more than 200 parks within the city, extend into the mountains and are scattered over a wide scenic area.[P10]State Capitol, Denver, Colo.© Bambi L.

A historic mining town, it originated in 1864 when the Belmont (silver) Lode was discovered nearby, and by the time that the Colorado Central Railroad arrived in 1877, it was producing vast amounts of silver. It was named for George Griffith, a local official. By the 1890s silver mining had declined and so had the town.[P1]GeorgetownGeorgetown, Colorado.© Andrew Lundquist/Shutterstock.com[ML1]Unlike many other Colorado mining towns, Georgetown did not experience a major fire, and many original Victorian buildings have survived and have been restored, notably Hamill House (1867) and the Hotel de Paris (1875), both on the National Register of Historic Places. The latter was built and operated by an eccentric Frenchman, Louis du Puy, whose outlook and epicurean tastes were highly unusual for the region; it was one of the most elegant hostelries west of the Mississippi River during its heyday and is now a museum owned by the Colonial Dames of America. Georgetown remains a tourist base for drives to surrounding ghost towns. A restored narrow-gauge railway runs between Georgetown and Silver Plume.

It lies in a canyon at an elevation of 5,758 feet (1,755 metres) and is surrounded by the White River National Forest, of which it is the headquarters. The curative value of the local hot springs and vapour caves was known to the Ute, Comanche, Cheyenne, and Arapaho Indians. In 1882 Isaac Cooper laid out the town site, which he named after Glenwood, Iowa. With the arrival of the Colorado Midland Railway in 1885, Glenwood Springs developed as a health spa and year-round resort; it also became a distribution point for local mineral and farm products. A nearby dam diverts water from the Colorado River through a 2.7-mile (4.3-km) tunnel and supplies power, via the Shoshone Hydroelectric Plant (7 miles [11 km] above the city), to Denver (159 miles [256 km] east). Roaring Fork Campus–Spring Valley was founded in Glenwood Springs in 1965. The Old West gunfighter Doc Holliday, who died of tuberculosis in 1887, is buried in the city’s Pioneer Cemetery.

Founded as a mining town in 1859, it was named Golden City for Tom Golden, a miner. From 1862 to 1867 Golden was the capital of the Colorado Territory, rivaling Denver as the state’s chief settlement. Until the late 1880s the city was the principal railhead for railroads entering the Rocky Mountains, another position eventually lost to Denver. Its manufactures now include porcelain, cans and bottles, units for nuclear reactors, and cement blocks; the city is also the site of Coors Brewing Company, founded as the Golden Brewery in 1873 by Adolph Coors and Jacob Schueler.

Lying between the Sawatch Range and the Elk Mountains, the city is surrounded by the Gunnison National Forest, for which it is headquarters. It originated as a silver-mining camp and was named for Captain John William Gunnison, an Indian fighter and railroad surveyor who had explored the area in 1853. The Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad arrived in 1881, and the city developed as a trade centre for mining and farming and as a recreation area. Its growth was sustained by the establishment there of Western State College of Colorado (1911). Gunnison is a popular angling centre, with many trout streams and several reservoirs (notably Taylor to the northeast and Blue Mesa to the west) in the vicinity.

It is situated in the upper Arkansas River valley in an area of national forests, at an elevation of some 10,200 feet (3,105 metres). It is the centre of one of the nation’s most celebrated mining districts, which has yielded gold, silver, lead, zinc, manganese, and molybdenum. Gold was discovered in nearby California Gulch in 1859, and Oro City, south of present Leadville, had a population of 5,000 in 1860. Gold mining declined in 1866, but the discovery that the carbonates of lead ores were laden with silver resulted in the founding of Leadville in 1878. When the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad reached the city in 1880, the population exceeded 30,000. More than 30 silver mines on Fryer’s Hill continued to yield heavily until the silver market collapsed in 1893, after which the population declined.[P1]LeadvilleDowntown Leadville, Colorado.© Matthew Trump[ML1]From roughly 1920 to the 1980s, much of the world’s molybdenum was produced at the nearby Climax Mine. The National Mining Hall of Fame & Museum, the Matchless Mine, and the Tabor Opera House are among the features of the city that recall life during the mining boom. Notable former residents of Leadville include the mining investor Horace A.W. Tabor and his second wife, Elizabeth “Baby Doe,” and Molly Brown. A 70-square-block area of Leadville has been designated a National Historic Landmark District. By the turn of the 21st century the city had become an arts centre with a decidedly bohemian flavour.

Colorado"Littleton"City"Arapahoe county"north-central Colorado"Littleton, city, seat (1904) of Arapahoe county, north-central Colorado, U.S. Parts of the city also lie within Douglas and Jefferson counties. Located 11 miles (18 km) south of Denver, the city arose on the site of a flour mill and granary established in 1867 to serve the gold camps in the Rocky Mountain foothills farther west. Named for Richard Sullivan Little, a hydraulic engineer who purchased a large tract of land and settled in the area, it was designated the village of Littleton in 1872, a year after the railroad arrived there. The local economy was largely agricultural until World War II, when several war matériel plants were built; many of those were converted to aerospace production after the war. Much of the original city centre was heavily damaged in a 1965 flood of the South Platte River, after which new housing developments were constructed.[P1]Once surrounded by farmlands, Littleton is now largely suburban and effectively indistinguishable from adjoining communities in the Denver metropolitan area. Alfred (or Alferd) Packer (1842–1907), infamous as a murderer and cannibal, lived in Littleton during the last years of his life and is buried in the city’s historic cemetery; his grave attracts many visitors. In 1999 the city’s Columbine High School was the site of a mass shooting by two students.

After the land was opened for settlement in 1881, a railway depot was established on the site. The town that grew up around it was named by an early citizen who was inspired by A Legend of Montrose (1819), a novel by Sir Walter Scott. By 1900 major canal projects irrigated land for farming, and later lumbering and mining (carnotite ores yielding uranium, vanadium, and radium) became important. In 1910 water diverted from the Gunnison River through the Gunnison Tunnel, 6 miles (9.7 km) long, increased irrigation facilities. The city is now a busy trading centre, with food- and wood-processing industries. The area is part of the Colorado River Storage Project.

Jim Beckwourth, a trader and onetime war chief of the Crow Indians, established a trading post, Fort Pueblo, on the site in 1842; the post was abandoned in 1854 following a period of hostilities between whites and Indians. A community called Fountain City developed in 1858 but was later absorbed by Pueblo City (laid out in 1860). Growth was stimulated by the arrival of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad in 1872 and the Santa Fe line in 1876. It lies near coalfields and is an important manufacturing, retail, and trucking centre for the surrounding Arkansas Valley irrigated agricultural region. Nearby Minnequa was home to the Colorado Fuel and Iron Corporation, once one of the nation’s largest steel plants and a significant economic and environmental factor in the region. The University of Southern Colorado originated as Pueblo Junior College (1933).

Telluride sprang up in 1875 as a mining camp called Columbia and quickly flourished with the discovery of abundant lodes of silver, gold, iron, zinc, lead, and copper. It was renamed in 1880 after the mineral tellurium, which is not found locally. A branch of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad arrived in 1890, when the town’s population reached 5,000. Most of the town’s residents were immigrants from mining districts in the British Isles and Scandinavia. The population fell with the collapse of the silver market in 1893, and by the mid-20th century Telluride had fewer than 500 residents. A ski area was developed in 1972 and became regionally and then internationally popular. The present town, a National Historic Landmark District, hosts film and music festivals throughout the year.

It grew from a whaling centre into an industrial centre after the opening of the railroad in 1840. In the 19th century Bridgeport’s industries produced carriages, brass and cast-iron fittings, sewing machines, tools, saddlery, and ammunition. By the 1930s the community had almost 500 manufacturing firms. In the late 20th century Bridgeport remained a manufacturing centre, producing electrical and transportation equipment, plastics, and machine tools. Bridgeport also had problems with unemployment, pollution, drugs, and crime in its inner-city neighbourhoods.[P2]P.T. Barnum, the well-known showman, was once the mayor of Bridgeport, and one of his star attractions—Charles S. Stratton, “General Tom Thumb”—was born there.

Originally settled as Quinnipiac in 1638 by a company of English Puritans led by John Davenport and Theophilus Eaton, it was renamed in 1640, probably for Newhaven, England. In 1643 it combined with several adjacent towns, including Milford and Guilford, to form the New Haven colony, of which Eaton was governor until his death in 1658. In 1665 New Haven colony reluctantly accepted absorption into the more liberal and democratic Connecticut colony, which was based in Hartford and enjoyed a royal charter. From 1701 New Haven was co-capital with Hartford, a position it maintained in both colony and state until 1875. During the American Revolution it was sacked (July 5, 1779) by loyalist forces under Major General William Tryon. The town was an important centre of abolitionist sentiment during the American Civil War.[P1]The Green, a park in downtown New Haven, Connecticut.Ewing Galloway[ML1]New Haven’s historical preeminence in many industrial fields is manifest in the number of inventions that first appeared in the area.

The settlement was seized by the Swedes in 1654 but was regained by the Dutch in 1655. It was named New Amstel and was made the Dutch capital of the southern Delaware region, but it was renamed in 1664 (probably for William Cavendish, earl and, from 1665, 1st duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne), after its capture by the British that year. William Penn, the English Quaker, took possession of it in 1682. An early cultural centre, New Castle was the seat of the Lower Counties-on-Delaware (1704–76). On September 21, 1776, a convention of counties meeting there proclaimed a constitution and formed the state of Delaware; New Castle served briefly as state capital until it was moved to Dover in 1777.

It is the state’s industrial, financial, and commercial centre and main port.[P1]The oldest permanent European settlement in the Delaware River valley was established on the site by Swedes in 1638. Called Fort Christina, it was captured by Peter Stuyvesant’s Dutch forces in 1655. The Dutch, who named the place Altena, were ousted by the English in 1664. A small agricultural hamlet for its first 100 years, it developed into a prosperous port and market town after the Quakers moved there in the 1730s. The Quakers secured a borough charter from Thomas Penn, the proprietor of Pennsylvania, who named the town (1739) for his friend Spencer Compton, earl of Wilmington.[P2]By the time of the American Revolution, Wilmington was the largest town in Delaware. Following the Battle of the Brandywine (September 11, 1777), the British captured John McKinly, the state president, in Wilmington and occupied the town. Subsequent growth was due to accessibility to other ports (especially Philadelphia, 25 miles [40 km] northeast), abundance of waterpower in nearby creeks, and the fertility of nearby farmlands. Sawmills, gristmills, and paper mills were built along Brandywine Creek, just north of Wilmington, and by the 1790s its flour mills were the largest in the United States. In 1802 a French immigrant, Eleuthère Irénée du Pont, established a gunpowder mill, the forerunner of the modern gigantic and diversified DuPont industries with their experimental laboratories in Wilmington. The city’s industrial development was given impetus by the completion (1837) of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore (later Penn Central) Railroad.[P3]Besides chemical products, manufactures include automobiles, leather goods, textiles, vulcanized fibre, rubber hose, and processed foods. Services are increasingly important, and the headquarters of many large corporations are located in the city.[P4]Among the city’s historic sites and museums are the Fort Christina Monument (by Swedish sculptor Carl Milles), marking the site of the original settlement; Old Swedes (Holy Trinity) Church (1698); Old Town Hall Museum (1798), with exhibits about Delaware’s history; Hagley Museum and Library, occupying the original Du Pont gunpowder mill complex and featuring exhibits dramatizing the industrial history along the Brandywine; and the Delaware Art Museum, noted for its collections of Pre-Raphaelite English art and American art.

After the war, the lumber industry (based on cypress) became important; fishing also gained in prominence, and sponges were a major commodity during the late 1800s. In the 1840s John Gorrie, a doctor in Apalachicola, invented a refrigeration apparatus to cool the rooms of yellow-fever patients (commemorated by the John Gorrie State Museum). The city’s name is derived from either a Hitchiti Indian word meaning “people on the other side” or a Choctaw word meaning “allies.”[P2]An important seafood-producing centre, Apalachicola is Florida’s largest producer of oysters. Tourism is another mainstay of the economy. Among the city’s attractions is the Ionic-columned Trinity Episcopal Church (1838), a notable landmark that was built with wood shipped from New York.

Although the Spanish occasionally used Boca Raton’s harbour, the first settlers arrived in the area about 1895, around the same time as the Florida East Coast Railway. The city’s name comes from boca de ratones, a Spanish term meaning “rat’s mouth” that appeared on early maps and referred to hidden sharp-pointed rocks that gnawed or fretted ships’ cables. The settlers grew vegetables and pineapples, and in the early 1900s Japanese farmers arrived and started the Yamato Colony in the area. The town of Boca Raton was incorporated in 1925, and the architect Addison Mizner began designing a luxury resort city centring on the Cloister Inn, a Spanish architectural extravaganza that the financier Clarence H.

Spaniards built a fort and a mission (c. 1686), which were destroyed by Governor James Moore of Carolina in 1702 when the British occupied Amelia Island. The town of Fernandina was named for either Don Domingo Fernandez, an 18th-century landowner, or King Ferdinand II of Spain (Aragon). The British took possession of the town in 1763, and large numbers of loyalists settled there during the American Revolution; most loyalists left in 1783 when Florida was ceded back to Spain. After becoming a free port (1807), the settlement thrived as a haven for smugglers, pirates, and slave traders. In 1817 Sir Gregor MacGregor, a Scottish military adventurer who wanted to liberate Florida from Spain, briefly held it captive. The pirate Luis Aury claimed the island for Mexico that same year, but it was soon taken over by the United States and held “in trust” for Spain. The United States took formal possession of Amelia Island in 1821 and built Fort Clinch (begun 1847) at its northern tip. The fort was seized by Confederate troops in 1861 at the beginning of the American Civil War and became a centre for blockade-running until its capture by Union forces in 1862. In the late 19th century Fernandina became a centre for tourism and shipping. Fernandina was consolidated with the nearby town of Fernandina Beach in 1951, taking the latter’s name.[P2]The city’s economy is still based on tourism; pulp and paper milling and fishing (especially shrimp) are also important.

Florida"Hallandale Beach"City"Broward county"southeastern Florida"Hallandale Beach, city, Broward county, southeastern Florida, U.S. It lies along the Atlantic Ocean, about 15 miles (25 km) north of Miami and just south of Hollywood. Settled by Swedish farmers in the late 1890s, it was laid out in 1898 and named for Luther Halland, a trading-post operator. The community was badly damaged by a devastating hurricane in 1926, which, along with the collapse of the Florida real estate boom, inhibited growth for a time. It subsequently developed as a tourist and retirement centre. The city changed its name from Hallandale to Hallandale Beach in 1999.

The area was originally inhabited by Tequesta and later by Seminole Indians. Settled in 1921 by aviation pioneer Glenn Curtiss and Missouri cattleman James H. Bright, the name is probably derived from a Seminole term meaning “pretty prairie” or “high prairie.” The city was severely damaged during a hurricane in 1926. It grew slowly until World War II brought industrial development to the region.[P1]Hialeah serves mainly as a residential suburb of Miami, and its population is predominantly Hispanic. Florida National College (1982) is in the city. The Hialeah Park horse-racing track (opened 1925) became famous for its elaborate landscaping and flamingos.

Florida"Homestead"City"Miami-Dade county"southern Florida"Homestead, city, Miami-Dade county, southern Florida, U.S., in the fertile Redland district, about 30 miles (50 km) southwest of Miami. The region was inhabited by Tequesta and then Calusa Indians before their disappearance by the early 19th century. Established in 1904 after the arrival of the railroad from Miami, the city took its name from its location in the “homestead country,” government land that was opened to homesteading in the late 1890s. It developed as a shipping centre for fruits and vegetables grown on the surrounding farmland. The city became an important agricultural-trading centre, the service centre for nearby Homestead Air Force Base, the headquarters for Everglades National Park (west and south of the city), and the gateway to the Florida Keys. Homestead was struck by three devastating hurricanes in the 20th century (1926, 1945, and 1992), but in each case the city was rebuilt; its economic prospects were hampered after the 1992 storm, however, by the restructuring of the air force base.[P1]Homestead: Coral CastleCoral Castle, Homestead, Florida.Ebyabe[ML1]Tourism and agriculture are the basis of the city’s economy, the chief crops including winter vegetables, tropical fruits, and ornamental plants.

Florida"Jacksonville"City"Duval county"northeastern Florida"Jacksonville, city, seat (1822) of Duval county, northeastern Florida, U.S., the centre of Florida’s “First Coast” region. It lies along the St. Johns River near its mouth on the Atlantic Ocean, about 25 miles (40 km) south of the Georgia border. Jacksonville consolidated (1968) with most of Duval county and thereby became one of the nation’s largest cities in area (841 square miles [2,178 square km]). The city is the focus of one of the state’s most populous urban areas.[P1]Riverfront and skyline of Jacksonville, Fla.Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty Images[ML1]The region was originally inhabited by Timucua peoples. Fort Caroline National Memorial marks the site of Florida’s first European (French Huguenot) settlement (1564), which was destroyed by Spanish conquistador Pedro Menéndez de Avilés in 1565. The locality was originally known as Wacca Pilatka (derived from a Timucua term meaning “cows’ crossing”), which was interpreted as Cowford during the English period (1763–83). The townsite was laid out in 1822, a year after the United States acquired Florida from Spain, and it was named for Andrew Jackson, who had briefly served as governor of the new territory. Industries such as lumber mills developed, but the city’s growth was impeded by the Seminole Wars; it was occupied four times by Union troops during the American Civil War. During Reconstruction it developed as a winter resort and expanded its industry after improvements were made to the harbour, despite a yellow-fever epidemic (1888) and widespread destruction by fire (1901). The waters off Jacksonville were the scene of much German U-boat activity during World War II, including the sinking of a tanker and a brief incursion of German saboteurs in 1942. The city was the nation’s busiest military port during the Persian Gulf War (1990–91).[P2]Jacksonville is an important deepwater port of entry and functions as the state’s foremost transportation and commercial centre. It is a major point of wholesale distribution for the southeastern United States, with motor vehicles being one of the most important cargoes. The city is the hub of regional road and rail networks, and its international airport (completed 1968) is one of the busiest in the state. Services, including insurance, health care, and banking, are also major factors in Jacksonville’s economy, as is employment at the area’s two U.S. naval air stations. Manufactures include contact lenses and paper products; shipbuilding, fishing, and tourism are also important.[P3]Several beach communities are adjacent to Jacksonville (Mayport, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, Jacksonville Beach, and Ponte Vedra Beach), and sport fishing is a popular tourist activity. Among the city’s cultural institutions are the Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens, the Jacksonville Museum of Contemporary Art, Jacksonville Zoological Gardens, and the Museum of Science and History. Kingsley Plantation on Fort George Island features a restored plantation house and slave cabins. The city also has its own National Football League team, the Jaguars. Big Talbot Island and Little Talbot Island state parks are nearby. The Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve (established 1988) protects an area of 72 square miles (185 square km) of coastal wetlands just north of the St. Johns River, and Guana River State Park is south along the coast.

Florida"Key West"City"Monroe county"southwestern Florida"Key West, city, seat (1824) of Monroe county, southwestern Florida, the southernmost city within the continental United States. It lies about 100 miles (160 km) from the mainland on a sand and coral island about 4 miles (6.5 km) long and 1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide in the western Florida Keys.[P1]Key West: southernmost point in continental United StatesSign indicating the southernmost point in the continental United States, in Key West, Fla.© MedioImages/Getty Images[ML1]The name is an English corruption of Cayo Hueso (“Bone Islet”), the name given to it by Spanish explorers who found human bones there. In 1815 the Spanish crown granted the island to a Spanish army officer, Juan Pablo Salas, who sold it to American businessman John Simonton in 1822. That year the island was occupied by U.S. forces under Matthew C. Perry, and a naval depot was soon established by David Porter as a base of operations against pirates. In 1886 a fire destroyed much of the town, which was subsequently rebuilt.[P2]The city’s early economy was based on fishing, salvaging shipwrecks, and cigar making. Throughout its history Key West has been a centre of military activity. It played an important role in the Spanish-American War (1898), and a U.S. naval air station has long been nearby. The railroad arrived in 1912, but was destroyed by a hurricane in 1935. It was replaced by the Overseas Highway (opened 1938), which connected the keys by 42 bridges (including one 7 miles [11 km] long) over vast expanses of water. The independent nature of Key West’s citizens was demonstrated in April 1982 when they protested the federal government’s imposition of a roadblock on the Overseas Highway (to search for illegal drugs) by staging a mock secession from the United States. The roadblock was removed, and the success of the self-declared Conch Republic has since been celebrated with an annual festival. Tourism and fishing are the basis of the city’s modern economy.[P3]Key West possesses a unique blend of Cuban, West Indian, Bahamian, and American atmosphere. The city is known for its architecture, particularly its many 19th-century wooden homes, and as a haven for writers, artists, and those preferring less conventional lifestyles. The home of Ernest Hemingway and the house that ornithologist John James Audubon occupied while living there are two of the many vintage structures that have been preserved. The city has a large gay and lesbian population.[P4]Key West lies within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, created in 1990. Several national wildlife refuges are in the area, and Dry Tortugas National Park (1992) is about 70 miles (115 km) west. Fort Zachary Taylor State Historic Site and the Key West Aquarium are in the city. The Mel Fisher Maritime Museum displays shipwreck artifacts, the Key West Shipwreck Historeum includes a re-creation of a shipwreck and salvage, and the Wreckers’ Museum has exhibits on the city’s former industry.

The Seminoles left under the terms of an 1824 treaty, and settlers moved in. An important settlement in early Florida, it was called Alligator until 1859, when it was incorporated and renamed Lake City for the many lakes that surround it. The only significant battle of the American Civil War fought in Florida took place on February 20, 1864, at Olustee, about 15 miles (25 km) east, and resulted in a Confederate victory.

The site, originally known as Crane Creek, was settled in 1878, and the community was soon renamed for Melbourne, Australia, the one-time home of the community’s first postmaster, Cornthwaite John Hector. A passenger steamer service existed until the Florida East Coast Railway arrived in 1893. Tourism (yachting and sport fishing), citrus growing, and cattle raising provided the town’s early economic base.[P1]Since 1950 Melbourne’s growth has been influenced by the space complex at Cape Canaveral to the north and a subsequent influx of aerospace industries.

Ibrahim/Getty Images[ML1] History Spaniards in the 16th century found a village (perhaps 2,000 years old) of Tequesta Indians on the site. The name Mayaimi, probably meaning “big water” or “sweet water,” may have referred to Lake Okeechobee or to local Native Americans who took their name from the lake. In 1567 the Spanish established a mission there as part of a futile attempt to subdue the Tequesta. They ceded the area to Great Britain in 1763 but regained it in 1783. After the United States acquired Florida from Spain in 1821, Fort Dallas was built (1836) as a base during the Seminole Wars. A few settlers—among them Julia D. Tuttle, known as the “mother of Miami,” and William B. Brickell—gradually moved into the area.[P2] In 1896 Henry M. Flagler extended his Florida East Coast Railway to the site after Tuttle and Brickell each gave him half of their landholdings for the project. Flagler had been convinced to extend the railroad after a freeze during the winter of 1894–95 killed most of Florida’s citrus crop; Tuttle reportedly sent him a fresh orange blossom to prove that the freeze had not reached Miami. Flagler dredged the harbour, started constructing the Royal Palm Hotel, and promoted tourism. Miami was incorporated the same year.[P3]Flagler, Henry MorrisonAmerican industrialist Henry Morrison Flagler.Courtesy of the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML3] During the Florida land boom in the early and mid-1920s, the city’s population more than tripled, but the collapse of this speculation, compounded by a devastating hurricane in 1926, dampened Miami’s fortunes for more than a decade. Neighbouring Miami Beach underwent a brief construction boom in the mid-1930s, when many Art Deco buildings were erected, but this came to an end during World War II, when soldiers replaced tourists at the oceanfront hotels and long stretches of beach were converted to rifle ranges. After the war, many soldiers returned to the Miami area to live, and in the 1950s and ’60s Latin American immigrants, particularly those from Cuba, began to arrive in large numbers. In the 15 years following the Cuban Revolution in 1959, it is estimated that some 500,000 Cubans fled to Miami; many of these immigrants received assimilation aid from the U.S. federal government. During the 1980s Miami gained a reputation as a centre of the illegal cocaine trade, and several acts of violence were directed against foreign tourists in the early 1990s; however, by the end of the 20th century, tourism was rebounding. In 1992 Hurricane Andrew caused some 50 deaths and considerable property damage to areas of the county just south of Miami, although the city itself was largely spared.[P4]Little Havana, MiamiStreet sign in English and Spanish in Little Havana, a mainly Cuban area of Miami, Florida.© Meunierd/Dreamstime.com[ML4] [H3]The contemporary city The downtown skyline of Miami features a contemporary look, with a large collection of gleaming glass-walled skyscrapers accented with neon lighting at night.

More than 70 percent of the population is Hispanic/Latino. Indeed, the city’s close relationship to Latin America is especially well represented in its ethnic neighbourhoods. The Little Havana district, just west of downtown, developed as a largely Cuban enclave within the city. Its annual Calle Ocho festival (March; part of the Carnaval Miami celebration) draws large crowds of visitors. Little Haiti, to the north of downtown, developed as a primarily Haitian neighbourhood after refugees began arriving in the city in the 1990s.[P5]Central Miami, Fla., and (left) Biscayne Bay.© Index Open[ML5] A tropical climate helps to make Miami one of America’s great winter resorts, and tourism is a major component of the city’s economy.

Until 1912 the site was a mangrove swamp, where growers tried unsuccessfully to establish coconut plantations but had better luck with avocado groves. John S. Collins, Carl Fisher, and John and James Lummus pioneered real estate development there, and through their efforts a bridge was built across the bay (followed by a causeway in 1920).

The site, once occupied by the Timucua Indians, who built Turtle Mound (50 feet [15 metres] high) out of shells, and the Spanish mission of Atocuimi (1696), was colonized in 1768 by a mixed immigrant group of Greeks, Minorcans, and Italians led by Andrew Turnbull, a Scottish physician, who named the place New Smyrna for his wife’s Turkish birthplace. Because of political and financial difficulties, the colony was abandoned in 1777 but not before sugarcane, corn (maize), rice, and indigo were planted and a system of irrigation and drainage canals was built. In 1803 settlement was renewed with land grants. Under the stimulus of the Florida East Coast Railway and the Intracoastal Waterway (via the Indian River), it developed as a processing and distribution point for citrus. Tourism, boating, and sport fishing became economic assets, and eventually “Beach” was added to the city’s name, probably in reference to its white, sandy shore.[P1]New Smyrna Sugar Mill Ruins State Historic SiteNew Smyrna Sugar Mill Ruins State Historic Site, near New Smyrna Beach, Florida.Ebyabe[ML1]Tourism, fishing, and manufacturing (including boats and paint) are major economic factors; agriculture is also important.

It developed around Fort King (established in 1827), an important post during the Seminole Wars. The city’s name was derived from Ocali, the Timucua Indian name for the province through which Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto passed in 1539; its literal meaning is unknown. After the Seminole Wars, Ocala evolved as an agricultural (citrus, corn [maize], cotton, and livestock) centre. In 1890 the Farmers Alliance held a national convention in the city and issued the Ocala Demands, summarizing their political stance. The city was reconstructed after the American Civil War, and many of its streets are lined with moss-draped oaks and stately Southern homes.[P1]Ocala: Appleton Museum of ArtAppleton Museum of Art, Ocala, Florida.Ebyabe[ML1]Local agricultural activities include breeding Thoroughbred horses, cultivating fruits, vegetables, and peanuts (groundnuts), and livestock raising (particularly cattle). Tourism and the manufacture of emergency vehicles, trucks and vans, shelving and storage units, and missiles are also important to the economy. Ocala lies just west of Ocala National Forest. It is the home of Central Florida Community College (1957). At nearby Silver Springs (east) aquatic life can be viewed through glass-bottomed boats.

The city is the focus for one of the state’s most populous metropolitan areas.[P1]Orlando: Walt Disney World ResortCinderella Castle, Walt Disney World Resort, near Orlando, Florida.© Aroas/Dreamstime.com[ML1]The region was originally inhabited by Timucua and later Seminole peoples. Settlement began about 1843 around Fort Gatlin, a U.S. Army post. First called Jernigan for Aaron Jernigan, an early settler, the town was renamed in 1857 to honour Orlando Reeves, an army sentry killed during the Seminole Wars. Prior to the American Civil War, the area was a cotton and cattle centre. After the war, citrus became a leading industry. The South Florida Railroad arrived in 1880 and was extended to Tampa in 1883. The development after 1950 of the Cape Canaveral aerospace complex, 50 miles (80 km) east, spurred population and economic growth, which were further boosted when Walt Disney World opened in 1971 about 20 miles (30 km) southwest. The construction of other attractions followed, and the city acquired a National Basketball Association franchise (the Orlando Magic) in 1987.[P2]The Disney complex alone covers 47 square miles (122 square km). In addition to its several large resorts, Walt Disney World has a variety of attractions, including the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney-MGM Studios, and Animal Kingdom. Universal Orlando Resort includes the Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure theme parks.

When incorporated as a town in 1880, it was renamed for either James Ormond (who had died there in 1815 after coming from the Bahamas to live on a Spanish land grant) or his family. Henry M. Flagler, a railroad pioneer and resort promoter, bought and enlarged the Hotel Ormond (1888), and several large estates developed, including John D. Rockefeller’s winter home, the Casements (now a city cultural centre). Early in the 20th century industrialists Henry Ford, Ransom E. Olds, Louis Chevrolet, and others tested automobiles on the Ormond-Daytona beach, and several world land speed records were broken there.[P2]Tourism remains the basis of Ormond Beach’s economy; manufacturing (including electrical equipment, metal products, sunscreen, and sunglasses) is also important.

Beginning in the 17th century the area was used for cattle ranching, and the city site was a crossing point of the river. James Marver established a trading post (c. 1821) on the site of a Seminole village. The city’s name came from Pilatka, a Seminole term meaning “crossing over,” or “cows’ crossing.” Palatka was the southernmost point on the river that oceangoing ships could reach and soon became a major transportation centre. During the Seminole Wars, Palatka was burned by Seminoles (1835), and Fort Shannon was built there (early 1840s). The settlement came under fire from gunboats in 1864 during the American Civil War and was occupied by Union troops. After the war it developed as a river port and winter resort with rail connections and had thriving tourism, lumber, and citrus industries. By the end of the 19th century, shipping, transportation, and citrus were no longer important.[P1]Palatka: city hallCity hall of Palatka, Fla.Ebyabe[ML1]Tourism and manufacturing (particularly wood products, including pulp, paper, furniture, and plywood) are the basis of the economy.

A Spanish settlement was made on the bay coast in 1559 but was abandoned two years later. The Spaniards formally took possession in 1698 and built Fort San Carlos de Austria, but this was ravaged during the colonial fighting between France and Spain in 1719–20. After the British gained control in 1763, Pensacola (a name derived from Pansfalaya, a local Native American tribe) became the capital of West Florida. It became a haven for loyalists during the American Revolution but in 1781 was taken by a Spanish force from Louisiana. In 1818 General Andrew Jackson captured the city during the First Seminole War.[P1]Historic Pensacola VillageLear-Rocheblave House in Historic Pensacola Village, Pensacola, Florida.Ebyabe[ML1]After Florida was ceded to the United States in 1821, Pensacola acquired a federal navy yard. The city was occupied by Confederates at the outbreak of the American Civil War, but Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island offshore remained in Union hands; in 1862 the Confederates evacuated the city. Lumbering and commercial fishing increased after the war, and industry developed. The navy yard became a naval air station in 1914, and the development of a large aviation training school there spurred the city’s economic growth.[P2]Tourism and the military are major components of the economy; health care, high-technology industries, and manufacturing (fibres, chemicals, paper products, and building materials) are also important. Pensacola’s landlocked deepwater port has access to the Intracoastal Waterway and to the gulf via a channel west of Santa Rosa Island, but its regional significance is somewhat overshadowed by the large port at Mobile.

He and Peter Demens, who built a railroad that reached the site in 1888, founded the city, and it was named for Demens’s birthplace in Russia. It quickly developed as a resort area, and seafood shipping on the Orange Belt Railroad was a major part of the city’s economy. In 1914 the world’s first scheduled passenger airline service linked St. Petersburg and Tampa, and the two cities were linked 10 years later by the Gandy Bridge, the first of two bridges and a causeway across Old Tampa Bay.

In 1821, when Florida became an American territory, it had two capitals, St. Augustine and Pensacola. As a central location between the two, Tallahassee (derived from a Creek word meaning “old town”) became the capital in 1824. The porticoed capitol building, begun in 1839, acquired its dome in 1902 and was restored after a new skyscraper capitol was completed in 1977. Prince Achille Murat, nephew of Napoleon I, and his wife, Catherine Willis, great-grandniece of George Washington, were early residents of the city. During the American Civil War, Tallahassee was far removed from the significant battle areas and was the only capital of a Confederate state east of the Mississippi River not captured by Union forces, although there was an engagement (March 6, 1865) at Natural Bridge, about 10 miles (16 km) southeast (now a state historic site) when a local militia repulsed a Union march on the city.[P2]Tallahassee is a trade and distribution point for the surrounding lumbering, agriculture, and livestock region; printing and publishing and the manufacture of electronic equipment and metal products are also of some importance. Services (associated with government or the area’s institutions of higher education) are a major component of the economy. The city is the seat of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (1887), Florida State University (1851), and Tallahassee Community College (1966).[P3]Local attractions include the Tallahassee Museum of History and Natural Science, the Museum of Florida History, and the Columns (1830), the city’s oldest building. The annual month-long Springtime Tallahassee (March–April) commemorates the city’s founding. Apalachicola National Forest borders Tallahassee on the southwest; on the city’s northern edge are Alfred B. Maclay State Gardens and Lake Jackson Mounds State Archaeological Site. Also nearby to the south are Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park and, on Apalachee Bay, St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge. Inc. 1825. Pop.

Florida"Tampa"City"Hillsborough county"west-central Florida"Tampa, city, seat (1834) of Hillsborough county, west-central Florida, U.S. It is situated on the northern shore of Tampa Bay at the mouth of the Hillsborough River and is connected to St. Petersburg and Clearwater (southwest and west) across the bay’s western arm (Old Tampa Bay) by the Gandy and Howard Frankland bridges and the Courtney Campbell Causeway. The three cities form one of Florida’s largest metropolitan areas.[P1]TampaTampa, Fla.Mike HaltermanTampa, Fla.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML1]Calusa and Timucua peoples (later replaced by the Seminoles) were early inhabitants of the area, which was visited by the Spanish explorers Pánfilo de Narváez (1528) and Hernando de Soto (1539). Settlement of Tampa began with Fort Brooke, established in 1824 to oversee the Seminoles. During the American Civil War the Confederates yielded the fort after bombardment by Union gunboats. Henry B. Plant’s South Florida Railroad arrived in 1884 and stimulated population growth and new industry. Plant developed port facilities extensively and promoted tourism, building the lavish, Moorish-style Tampa Bay Hotel in 1891. Cigar manufacturing was introduced in 1886 by Vicente Martinez Ybor, and Ybor City, Tampa’s Latin quarter, became a centre of that industry; although some cigars are still made in Ybor City, the enclave is now mainly a tourist spot.[P2]Tampa was the embarkation point (1898) for Cuba-bound troops, including those of Theodore Roosevelt, during the Spanish-American War. A fire destroyed a large part of Ybor City in 1908, which was subsequently rebuilt. The world’s first scheduled passenger-airline service, which connected Tampa to St. Petersburg, was inaugurated in 1914, and the Gandy Bridge between the two cities opened 10 years later. In 1928 Tampa was connected by road to Miami via the Tamiami Trail. In the 1920s the man-made Davis Islands were created offshore in Hillsborough Bay (Tampa Bay’s eastern arm) for real estate development. The origin of the city’s name is uncertain; it may be derived from a Creek word for “near it” or “a nearby place,” for its proximity to the bay, or it may mean “split wood for quick fire,” in reference to driftwood on the shore used for firewood.[P3]The Port of Tampa is the state’s largest deepwater port. Phosphates (an early economic factor) and citrus account for much of the port’s exports, while imports include petroleum, coal, and steel. In addition to the port, the international airport and network of railroads and highways make Tampa the regional trade and distribution centre. The city’s economy is well diversified; other major factors include financial and insurance services, manufacturing (notably medical products, fertilizer, electronics, and apparel), high-technology industries, and tourism. MacDill Air Force Base, on a peninsula at the city’s southern end, is another important part of the economy. Agriculture in the region includes strawberries, tomatoes, ornamental plants, citrus, beef, poultry, and dairy. The Tampa Bay area is a popular retirement spot.[P4]The Gasparilla Pirate Fest, a February event highlighted by a pirate invasion of the city, is held annually in Tampa; its theme is based on legendary pirate Jose Gaspar, who is said to have terrorized western Florida in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, an amusement park and zoo with an African theme, is a popular tourist attraction. The city’s cultural institutions include the Florida Aquarium, the Museum of Science and Industry, the Tampa Museum of Art, and the Ybor City State Museum (which traces the history of the area’s cigar industry). The city has a large performing arts centre where dance, music, and theatre performances are held. Tampa is also the home of two professional sports teams, the National Football League Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the National Hockey League Tampa Bay Lightning. (The region’s professional baseball team, the Tampa Bay Rays, plays in St. Petersburg.) Hillsborough River State Park is northeast of the city.[P5]The city is the seat of Hillsborough Community College (1968), the University of South Florida (1956), Tampa College (1890; now part of Florida Metropolitan University), and the University of Tampa (1931); the main building of the latter institution is Plant’s Tampa Bay Hotel.

The area was settled in 1876, and the city was founded in 1882 by Anson P.K. Safford, a former governor of the Arizona Territory. It was named by one of the first settlers for what she thought were tarpon, a large, silvery game fish, leaping in the ocean. In 1890 John K. Cheney, an early settler, founded the natural sponge industry in Tarpon Springs, which became one of the world’s largest; beginning in 1905, Greek divers came to the city to work in the sponge industry. A blight in the sponge beds in the 1940s considerably reduced the fleet, which in its heyday comprised more than 200 vessels. In the 1980s healthy sponge beds were found, and sponges again became important. The Spongeorama Exhibit Center focuses on the history of this industry.

Kennedy Space Center on northern Merritt Island.[P1]TitusvilleSt. Gabriel's Episcopal Church, Titusville, Fla., U.S.[ML1]In 1513 Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León visited nearby Cape Canaveral. Titusville was founded in 1867 near a post office known as Sand Point by Colonel Henry T. Titus, for whom it was renamed in 1873. When incorporated in 1887, it was a port served by a mule-drawn railway that carried freight as far as Sanford, about 30 miles (50 km) inland. In the late 1880s the Jacksonville, Tampa, and Key West Railroad was extended to Titusville, which then developed as a citrus shipping point and commercial fishing port. It consolidated with Indian River City and Whispering Hills in 1963. The advent of space-exploration activities at Cape Canaveral greatly stimulated Titusville’s growth in the 1950s and ’60s.[P2]The city’s economy is dominated by tourism and the nearby aerospace research and industrial complex. The Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex includes films and exhibits on space exploration as well as a replica space shuttle.

The town of Palm Beach lies opposite the city on the barrier island.[P1]West Palm BeachWest Palm Beach, Fla.Andyxox[ML1]The area, homesteaded in 1880 by Irving R. Henry, a settler from North Carolina, was developed after the arrival in 1894 of Henry M. Flagler’s Florida East Coast Railway. Using the town as a workers’ base and transfer point, Flagler developed a winter resort across the lagoon at Palm Beach. As transport facilities improved (which, in addition to the railroad, included constructing the West Palm Beach Canal westward to Lake Okeechobee), West Palm Beach also became a tourist centre, as well as the commercial and financial hub of the area.[P2]Tourism is still the basis of West Palm Beach’s economy, and manufacturing (including jet and rocket engines), high-technology industries, and citrus shipping are also important. The area has a large retiree population. The Port of Palm Beach, one of the busiest ports in the state, is immediately to the north.[P3]The city is the home of Palm Beach Atlantic College (1968).

The Timucua peoples considered the springs sacred, and warring tribes went there to enjoy the waters and put aside their differences. Later the Seminoles used the springs for a similar purpose. Settlement began in 1835, and the town grew as a health resort. Cotton and timber were also important to the town’s growth. During the American Civil War the area was known as Rebels’ Refuge because many coastal residents moved there, away from Union invasions. After the war the town continued to grow until 1911, when a fire destroyed much of it.[P1]White Springs: Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State ParkCarillon tower at Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park, White Springs, Florida.Ebyabe[ML1]Phosphate mining is a local industry.

Fruits and vegetables were grown there, and by the early 1900s citrus groves had been planted, and the city had a canning factory. It was incorporated in 1911 and in 1924 amalgamated with nearby Florence Villa to form the City of Winter Haven.[P1]The citrus industry, phosphate mining, and tourism are the city’s economic mainstays. Insurance and manufacturing (including building materials) are also important. The many area lakes provide water sports and fishing opportunities, and the region has a large retiree population.

In November 1863, Confederate authorities selected Andersonville, through which ran a stream, as the site for a stockade encompassing 16.5 acres (6.7 hectares). Prisoners began to arrive in February 1864, before the prison was completed and before adequate supplies had been received, and by May their number amounted to about 12,000. In June the stockade was enlarged to 26 acres (10.5 hectares), but the congestion was only temporarily relieved, and by August the number of prisoners exceeded 32,000.[P2]Camp Sumter, Andersonville, Georgia, colour lithograph, 1890.© 1890 J.W. Morton, Jr./Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. (digital. id. ccph 3g10808)[ML2]No shelter had been provided for the inmates; the first arrivals made rude sheds from the debris of the stockade, and the others made tents of blankets and other available pieces of cloth or dug pits in the ground. By that time the resources of the Confederacy were stretched thin, and the prison was frequently short of food. Even when food was sufficient in quantity, it was of poor quality and was poorly prepared because of the lack of cooking utensils. The water supply, deemed ample when the prison was planned, became polluted under the congested conditions, and the medical staff was inadequate and poorly provisioned. During the summer of 1864 the prisoners suffered greatly from hunger, exposure, and disease, and in seven months about one-third of them died. In the autumn of 1864, after William Tecumseh Sherman’s Union forces had captured Atlanta, all the prisoners who could be moved were sent to Millen, Georgia, and Florence, South Carolina. Arrangements at Millen were better, and, when Sherman began his March to the Sea, some 5,000 prisoners were returned to Andersonville, where the conditions also were somewhat improved. In all, nearly 13,000 Union prisoners died at Andersonville from disease, malnutrition, and other causes.[P3]Replica of a gate at Camp Sumter, Andersonville National Historic Site, Georgia.© Norman Bateman/Shutterstock.com[ML3]Conditions in Andersonville were utilized as propaganda material in the North, where Secretary of War Edwin M.

Lying as it does at the southern extremity of the Appalachian Mountains, it became the gateway through which most overland traffic had to pass between the southern Atlantic Seaboard and regions to the west. In 1837 a spot near what is now Five Points, in the centre of the present-day city, was selected for the southern terminus of a railroad that was subsequently built northward to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The location was known first as Terminus and then as Marthasville; in 1845 it was renamed Atlanta for the Western and Atlantic Railroad. Several other rail lines had converged on the city by 1860.[P2] During the American Civil War Atlanta became a supply depot, a site of Southern war industries, and the keystone of Confederate rail transportation east of the Mississippi River. It was thus the prime military objective of General William Tecumseh Sherman’s invasion of Georgia from Chattanooga (see Atlanta Campaign). The city fell to his Union troops on September 1, 1864, and was converted into a military camp. On November 15 Sherman departed on his devastating “March to the Sea,” but not before much of the city had been burned.[P3]Destruction of a rolling mill and a Confederate ordnance train on the Georgia Central Railroad during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML3] During Reconstruction Atlanta was a centre of federal government activities in the South. It was the site of the convention that drew up the Georgia constitution of 1868, and under the Republican state administration it became the state capital (chosen permanently by popular referendum in 1877). Atlanta came to epitomize the spirit of the “New South,” having risen from the ashes of the Civil War and become an advocate of reconciliation with the North in order to restore business. This spirit was dramatized by three Atlanta expositions: the International Cotton (1881), the Piedmont (1887), and the Cotton States and International (1895). At the last one, educator Booker T. Washington made his historic declaration (the Atlanta Compromise) urging African Americans to seek economic security before political or social equality with whites.[P4] The spirit of the city has tended to be liberal within the framework of Southern conservatism, though its customs have been influenced by the Protestant church traditions of the Bible Belt. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., was born and raised in Atlanta; his boyhood home, Ebenezer Baptist Church (where he and his father once preached), and his grave site adjacent to the church are preserved at the Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site. In 1973 Atlanta became the first major city in the South to elect an African American mayor, Maynard Jackson.[P5] [H3]The contemporary city Atlanta is still the focal point of an important network of rail lines and interstate highways. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, 10 miles (16 km) southwest of downtown Atlanta, is one of the world’s busiest airports. The first rapid-transit commuter rail opened in 1979, and by the early 21st century the system had expanded to include several more lines. Atlanta remains the financial and commercial capital of the Southeast and is its most important distribution centre. Printing and publishing, high-technology industries, telecommunications, airline services, military and government services, and banking and insurance are supplemented by industries producing aircraft, beverages, automobiles, electronics and electrical equipment, chemicals, processed foods, and paper products. Atlanta is also the focus of federal government activity in the Southeast and is the headquarters of the 6th Federal Reserve District. The city itself is relatively small but is surrounded by a sprawl of low-density suburbs.[P6] Atlanta is a major educational centre, with more than 40 degree-granting institutions in the metropolitan area. The city has a prestigious consortium of historically black colleges, notably Morehouse College (1867), Spelman College (1881), and Clark Atlanta University, the latter formed in 1988 by the merger of Atlanta University (1865) and Clark College (1869). Others schools include Emory University (1836), Georgia Institute of Technology (1885), Georgia State University (1913), and Oglethorpe University (1835).

Georgia"Augusta"City"Richmond county"eastern Georgia"Augusta, city, river port, and seat (1777) of Richmond county, eastern Georgia, U.S. It lies on the Savannah River (there bridged to North Augusta, South Carolina), on the fall line where the Piedmont Plateau meets the Coastal Plain. The area was explored in 1540 by the Spanish conquistador Hernando de Soto, but not until 1735 was a fortified fur-trading post established on the site (now marked by a Celtic cross) by James Edward Oglethorpe, the founder of Georgia. The ensuing settlement was named for Princess Augusta, mother of England’s George III.[P1]AugustaAugusta, Ga.Nbreese[ML1]During the American Revolution, Augusta was the site of bitter fighting and bloody reprisal, changing hands several times between the British and Americans. Twice during the struggle it served briefly as temporary capital of Georgia and then was the capital again in 1785–95. The Georgia state convention ratified the U.S. Constitution there on January 2, 1788. During the American Civil War the largest gunpowder factory in the Confederacy was located in Augusta; its 176-foot (54-metre) chimney remains, and there is a memorial to the war dead. Many well-preserved buildings of Georgian and Classic Revival design, notably the Ezekiel Harris House (1797) and the Gertrude Herbert Institute of Art (1818), stand along tree-shaded streets.[P2]One of the early milling towns of the South, and still a centre for cotton trading, it is an important textile-manufacturing centre. Nearby deposits of high-grade kaolin are mined for use in the manufacture of paper, paints, rubber, and ceramics. Manufactures are highly diversified, and agricultural industries are important. The J. Strom Thurmond (Clark Hill) Dam, one of a series of dams on the Savannah above Augusta for hydroelectric power production and flood control, helps ensure water levels in the river port below the city.[P3]Augusta State University, originally part of the Academy of Richmond County (1783), was chartered as a college in 1925; in 2013 it merged with Georgia Health Sciences University to become Georgia Regents University, which includes the Medical College of Georgia (founded as the Medical Academy of Georgia in 1828). The city is also home to Paine College (1882). Augusta National Golf Club in the city hosts the annual Masters Tournament, one of professional golf’s most prestigious events. Fort Gordon, site of the U.S. Army Signal Center and several Signal Corps schools, is located southwest of downtown; and the Savannah River Site, a federal nuclear-weapons facility, is about 15 miles (24 km) southeast in South Carolina.

The old statehouse (restored after a fire in 1941) is now part of Georgia Military College (founded 1879). The Old Governor’s Mansion (1838) is on the campus of Georgia College and State University (chartered as a women’s teaching college in 1889).[P1]The city is an agricultural trading centre, with light manufacturing (textiles, aircraft parts, and ceramic products from local clays) and tourism also contributing to the economy. It is the site of the Central State Hospital (founded in 1837 as the State Sanitarium). The writer Flannery O’Connor spent much of her life in Milledgeville; her library and papers are collected at Georgia College and State University, her alma mater. Lockerly Arboretum is just southwest of the city, and a segment of Oconee National Forest lies about 15 miles (25 km) to the northwest. Inc. town, 1806; city, 1836. Pop.

Rome was founded in 1834 on the site of a Cherokee village and was incorporated as a city in 1847. It became a clearinghouse for cotton and farm produce between Georgia and Tennessee. During the American Civil War the city was captured and occupied for several months in 1864 by Union forces, who destroyed its industrial facilities as they departed. It was rebuilt after a disastrous flood (1886), and textile milling became important.[P1]RomeFloyd County Courthouse, Rome, Ga.Christopher James Culberson[ML1]Rome now has a diversified economy based on manufacturing (textiles, paper, baked goods, and metal products), lumbering, and agriculture; tourism is also important. Shorter College (1873) and Floyd College (1970) are in Rome, and Berry College (1902) is at nearby Mount Berry. The 104-foot (32-metre) clock tower, built atop one of Rome’s hills, is a notable landmark. The Capitoline Wolf, a bronze replica of the Etruscan statue of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf that was given to the city by Italy in 1929, stands in front of City Hall.

Georgia"Savannah"City"Chatham county"southeastern Georgia"Savannah, industrial seaport city, seat (1777) of Chatham county, southeastern Georgia, U.S., at the mouth of the Savannah River. Savannah was established in 1733 by James Edward Oglethorpe, the founder of Georgia, who named it for the river. The city was planned around a system of squares, which have been made into small parks and planted with semitropical flora; these are surrounded with buildings in a variety of architectural styles (notably Georgian Colonial and Greek Revival), and hundreds have been restored. Savannah exceeds all other Georgia cities in historic interest and is a leading tourist centre.[P1]SavannahSavannah, Ga.Akhenaton06[ML1]The birthplace of the Georgia colony, Savannah was the seat of colonial government and was the capital of the state until 1786. Methodist founders John and Charles Wesley arrived in 1736 to preach to the colonists and the Native Americans. Evangelist George Whitefield joined the Wesleys in 1738 and two years later founded Bethesda, one of the first orphanages in America. During most of the American Revolution the town was occupied by loyalist forces; it was the focus of a failed French-American attack (October 9, 1779), during which colonial army officer Kazimierz Pulaski was mortally wounded.[P2]Port traffic, begun in 1744, increased steadily as Georgia’s plantation (tobacco and cotton) economy grew and transportation infrastructure was developed in the hinterland. The Savannah, the first steamboat to cross the Atlantic Ocean, sailed from there to Liverpool, England, in 1819. During the American Civil War, Savannah was an important supply point for the Confederacy until Fort Pulaski (on Cockspur Island 15 miles [25 km] east, now a national monument) fell to Union troops in April 1862. Commerce suffered because of the Union blockade, but the city—the objective of General William Tecumseh Sherman’s march to the sea—was not captured until December 21, 1864. It recovered fairly rapidly despite a yellow-fever epidemic in 1876.[P3]Savannah’s history since 1900 has revolved largely around its industrialization and growth as a maritime centre. It is a leading port in the southeastern United States for manufactured goods; major industries include shipbuilding and the production of paper, food, chemicals, and aircraft. Army installations (Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield) are in the vicinity. The city is the seat of Savannah State (1890) and Armstrong Atlantic State (1935) universities. Savannah National Wildlife Refuge is 10 miles (16 km) upriver, and Tybee and Wassaw national wildlife refuges are located along the Atlantic coast adjacent to the city.

Roosevelt’s visit there in 1924 following an attack of polio. Convinced that the warm waters would aid in the aftercare of polio victims who needed supported exercise, Roosevelt organized the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation in 1927. This nonprofit corporation developed a complete medical community there; its 940-acre (380-hectare) facility was purchased by the state of Georgia in 1973.

First settled by the Stephen Heard family from Virginia in 1773, it was laid out in 1780 and was one of the first U.S. communities to be named in honour of George Washington. During the American Revolution the Battle of Kettle Creek (February 14, 1779), which was fought nearby, disrupted the British plans to recapture Georgia. The last Cabinet meeting of the Confederacy was held there on May 5, 1865, at the end of the American Civil War. Local residents, who call the city Washington-Wilkes (to distinguish it from Washington, D.C.), perpetuate the legend that when Union troops seized the Confederate treasury (June 1865), they missed $100,000 in gold that remains buried in the vicinity.

Hawaii"Hanalei"Village"Kauai county"on the north-central coast of Kauai island"Hanalei, village, Kauai county, on the north-central coast of Kauai island, Hawaii, U.S. Near the head of Hanalei (“Crescent”) Bay, the village is in the scenic and fertile Hanalei Valley, which reaches depths of more than 3,400 feet (1,050 metres). Missionaries arrived at the site in 1834. The Waioli Mission House (1837), now used as a community centre, was built of coral limestone blocks and combines the starkness of a New England clapboard house with Hawaiian features such as lanais (porches), wide eaves, and long, sloping roof lines. This synthesis exerted a strong influence on subsequent Hawaiian architecture. Hanalei Valley is one of the state’s few rice-producing regions (though rice farming has declined), and the area grows much of Hawaii’s taro crop (taro has been grown in the area for more than 1,000 years). The Wainiha Power Plant, 4 miles (6 km) northwest, is serviced by waterfalls—fed by Alaka‘i Swamp—that pour over the nearby Wainiha palis (“cliffs”). The locality around Princeville (east) has been developed into a resort complex, and Lumahai Beach (west) is noted for its scenic beauty. The valley is part of the nearly 1,000-acre (400-hectare) Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge (closed to the public), which has some 50 species of birds.

Hawaii"Hilo"City"Hawaii county"northeastern Hawaii island"Hilo, city, seat of Hawaii county, northeastern Hawaii island, Hawaii, U.S. It lies along Hilo Bay and is the island’s business centre. Polynesians settled the area about 1100 ce, establishing agricultural and fishing communities. Christian missionaries arrived c. 1822 and were followed by whaling and trade ships that did business in Hilo’s port. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city attracted tourists who came to view the island’s active volcanoes. In 1946 and 1960 the city was damaged by tsunamis. Tourism increased dramatically after 1967, when direct air links with the U.S. mainland began. Sugar was once the city’s economic mainstay, but the industry has since declined. Hilo supports a thriving orchid industry. Exports include orchids, papaya, anthuriums, macadamia nuts, and cattle. Its deepwater harbour is protected by a breakwater. Wailoa River flows through the area and provides berths for a large fishing fleet. Hilo’s lush beauty is fed by more than 275 days of rain per year, a factor in its much slower growth as a tourist spot compared with other destinations in Hawaii.[P1]Sawkins, James Gay: Hilo from the Bay Hilo from the Bay, oil on canvas by James Gay Sawkins, 1852; in the Honolulu Academy of Arts.Photograph by Christopher Hu.

LC-DIG-highsm-04039)[ML1]Located on a lava shelf that dips into the Pacific Ocean, the refuge (puuhonua), one of several sacred spots that provided sanctuary in times of war, was established by at least the 15th century. Warriors, fugitives, and taboo breakers escaped death if they reached the site ahead of their pursuers; after remaining a few days and performing religious services, they were free to depart, protected by the gods. It was the most important refuge in the islands. The square-shaped refuge lies between the ocean and an L-shaped 1,000-foot- (300-metre-) long lava wall that was built about 1550 and averages 10 feet (3 metres) in height and 17 feet (5 metres) in width. Three heiaus (ceremonial and religious structures) are within the wall; Alealea Heiau is the largest, and Hale O Keawe (dating from 1650) was a depository for the bones of deified kings and chiefs. During the reign of King Kamehameha II, the old religious practices were forbidden (1819) and the temples razed. In 1961 the area was declared a national historical park (Pu‘uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park), which includes some 180 acres (75 hectares).[P2]Nearby St. Benedict’s Church, called the Painted Church for its colourful murals depicting biblical scenes, was the first Roman Catholic church in Hawaii.

Overlooked by Captain James Cook and other early explorers, the harbour with its outlet through the reef of Nuuanu Stream and sheltered by Sand Island was entered by Captain William Brown in 1794. After 1820 Honolulu assumed first importance in the islands and flourished as a base for sandalwood traders and whalers. A Russian group arrived there in 1816, and the port was later occupied by the British (1843) and the French (1849) but was returned to King Kamehameha III, who on August 31, 1850, officially declared Honolulu a city and the capital of his kingdom (Honolulu had been the de facto capital since 1845). In December 1941 the city and the adjacent Pearl Harbor naval-military complex came under Japanese aerial attack. Honolulu became a prime staging area for the remainder of World War II, a position it retained during the Korean War and until the end of the Indochina (Vietnam) conflict in 1973.

Hawaii"Laie"Town"Honolulu county"northeastern Oahu island"Laie, Hawaiian Lā‘ie, town, Honolulu county, on Laie Bay, northeastern Oahu island, Hawaii, U.S. The land was acquired by Mormon missionaries in 1864 and settled by a colony of Hawaiian Mormons. The impressive white Laie Temple, where the highest rites of the Mormon church can be performed, was built in 1919 on the site of an ancient Hawaiian “city of refuge” (puuhonua; “a sanctuary for the pursued”). The Polynesian Cultural Center, a project of the Mormon church, is Laie’s main tourist attraction (particularly its famous authentic luau). Laie is also the seat of Brigham Young University–Hawaii campus (formerly the Church College of Hawaii [1955]).

Hawaii"Wahiawa"City"Honolulu county"central Oahu island"Wahiawa, Hawaiian Wahiawā, city, Honolulu county, central Oahu island, Hawaii, U.S. Lying 22 miles (35 km) northwest of Honolulu, it is situated on the 1,000-foot- (300-metre-) high Leilehua Plateau between the two forks of the Kaukonahua Stream. The area was once used as a training ground for Oahu warriors, and from at least the 14th century it was considered a sacred place where royal mothers went to give birth to ensure the status of their children; Kukaniloko Birthstones State Monument marks the location of this ancient site. Founded in 1898, the city of Wahiawa (Hawaiian: “Place of Noise”) is a commercial centre for nearby plantation communities and military installations (Schofield Barracks and Wheeler Army Airfield). Pineapples are the area’s leading crop. Popular tourist sites include the 27-acre (11-hectare) Wahiawa Botanical Garden and the Dole Pineapple Pavilion, which features a pineapple garden maze and a garden with several varieties of pineapples.

Hawaii"Wailuku"City"Maui county"northern Maui island"Wailuku, city, seat of Maui county, northern Maui island, Hawaii, U.S. It is situated on an isthmus at the mouth of the Iao Valley and the base of Maui’s western mountains. With Kahului (east) it forms a contiguous area that is the most densely populated and busiest on the island. Iao Stream flows through the western part of the city. Wailuku (Hawaiian: “Water of Destruction”) recalls the Battle of Kepaniwai (1790), which added Maui to the kingdom of Kamehameha I. In the 19th century, missionaries settled in Wailuku; the Bailey Museum—housed in a missionary home built in 1833 in the area where Maui’s kings once lived—features Hawaiian and missionary-era artifacts, including Duke Kahanamoku’s 150-pound (80-kg) redwood surfboard. Sugar was long the mainstay of the economy, but its importance declined dramatically in the late 20th century. The city’s economy is now largely dependent on tourism, woodworking products, and hula supplies. Products are shipped from the port of Kahului. The Kepaniwai Park and Heritage Gardens contains re-creations of ancient Hawaiian homes and Chinese and Japanese gardens and Kaahumanu Church (1837; present building, 1876). The church was built to honour Queen Kaahumanu, who embraced Christianity and assisted its spread in Hawaii. Nearby is Halekii-Pihana Heiaus State Monument, which preserves two heiaus (ceremonial and religious structures) that were used by Kahekili, Maui’s last king; the temples were sometimes used for human sacrifices.

 Hawaii"Waimea"Town"Kauai county"southwestern Kauai island"Waimea, town, Kauai county, southwestern Kauai island, Hawaii, U.S. Waimea, whose name means “Reddish Water,” is situated on Waimea Bay at the mouth of the Waimea River. The valleys of the Waimea River and its tributary, the Makaweli River, were once heavily populated, and the town was an early centre of native Hawaiian government. It was at Waimea on January 20, 1778, that the English navigator-explorer Captain James Cook made his first landing in the Hawaiian Islands (a monument now marks the landing). Waimea developed as a provisioning port for whalers and sandalwood traders. A ruined Russian fort (Fort Elizabeth), built in 1815 in a futile attempt to seize Kauai island, occupies a coastal bluff above the Waimea River. Sugar was once the economic mainstay, but production has declined. The history of the sugar industry is preserved at the Waimea Sugar Mill Camp Museum (1996); a resort has been built on the lands of one former sugar plantation. Nearby is Waimea Canyon, which is the focus of a nearly 1,900-acre (750-hectare) state park and was allegedly dubbed by Mark Twain, who had a lifelong affection for the “Sandwich Islands,” the “Grand Canyon of the Pacific.” The Pacific Missile Range Facility, Barking Sands, operated by the U.S. Navy and located on the coast near Mana, conducts subsurface, surface, air, and space missile tests. A famous landmark is Menehune Ditch, a large irrigation system built of smoothed lava stone; according to legend, the structure, constructed before Polynesian settlement, was built in one night by menehunes (“little people”).

It lies along the Boise River in the southwestern part of the state. Because mountains to the north protect it from Canadian blizzards, Boise has relatively mild winters, as well as hot, dry summers.[P1]BoiseSkyline of Boise, Idaho.Glen Allison/Getty Images[ML1]Boise was named by early 19th-century French Canadian trappers for the tree-lined river (French boisé, “wooded”) that provided relief for travelers crossing the desolate Snake River plain. Following the 1862 gold rush to the Boise River basin, Fort Boise was established (July 4, 1863), and a community developed to provide services for the nearby mines. Its location at the crossroads of the Oregon Trail and the routes to the Boise Basin and Owyhee mines ensured Boise’s early growth, and it became the capital of Idaho in 1864. After 1902 the Boise Irrigation Project built nearby Arrowrock Dam and several other dams on the Boise River to provide the region with water storage and recreational facilities. Agricultural expansion and the growth of a commercial lumber industry contributed to Boise’s rapid growth in the early 20th century. One of the world’s largest construction companies also grew up there.[P2]Boise: Idaho State CapitolIdaho State Capitol building, in Boise.© Charles Knowles/Shutterstock.comBoise, IdahoDowntown Boise, Idaho, U.S.© IDAK/Shutterstock.com[ML2]The city’s diversified industries now include agriculture (fruit, sugar beets, and livestock), lumbering, electronics, and wholesale trade and trucking. Growth in the high-tech industries around Boise accounted for much of the city’s increase in population during the 1990s. Federal and state government agencies also provide much local employment. Boise’s numerous city parks contain specimens of trees from all over the world, many planted by U.S. presidents and visiting dignitaries. Buildings of historical interest include the Assay Office (1871), Old Idaho Penitentiary (built c. 1870, closed 1973), and the Idaho Historical Museum (1907).

Founded in 1879 as a trading post serving Fort Coeur d’Alene (later Fort Sherman), it developed after the discovery of lead and silver (1883) and the arrival of the railroad (1886). The local mines were the scene of bitter industrial strife between mine owners and unionized miners in the 1890s and into the 20th century; leaders of the union, including secretary-treasurer William D. (“Big Bill”) Haywood, were prosecuted for murder in 1907 but were acquitted following a spirited argument by defense attorney Clarence Darrow. The city is now headquarters for the Idaho Panhandle National Forest, which includes Kaniksu (in Montana), Coeur d’Alene, and St. Joe national forests.

It lies in a mountainous area of Boise National Forest at an elevation of 4,400 feet (1,340 metres), 24 miles (39 km) northeast of Boise. Perhaps the most famous of Idaho’s early boomtowns, it was founded as Bannock in 1862 during the great gold-mining rush into the Boise Basin and in its heyday had a population of 30,000–40,000. It became the transportation, commercial, and social hub of central and southwestern Idaho and was named the territorial capital. Placer mining, however, quickly declined, and by 1869 the population had dwindled to 1,000. By 1918 almost all local mining activities had ceased. The city has been disfigured by fires, dredging, and decay. Surviving relics include the Masonic Hall, Gold Hill (once a rich placer ground), St. Joseph’s Catholic Church, Boise Basin Museum (in the original post office [1867]), and Boot Hill Cemetery.

Established as a prospecting camp in 1893 and originally called Milo, it was renamed (1894) to honour Noah S. Kellogg, discoverer of the Bunker Hill Mine. The community developed as a mining and smelting centre for lead, zinc, and silver. Bunker Hill (combined with the Sullivan) is one of the world’s largest lead mines. The Sunshine Mine, a few miles east of Kellogg, is one of the largest single-lode producers of silver in the United States; in 1972 it was the scene of a disastrous fire that killed 91 miners. A downturn in the world metals-production market led to severe layoffs in the 1980s, and production was limited thereafter. The mining activities in the region also made it “one of the largest and most complex abandoned hazardous waste sites” in the United States; cleanup was in progress at the turn of the 21st century.

Originally an intermontane stopover point on the Oregon Trail, it was settled in 1882 and named for a Shoshone Bannock Indian leader who granted rights-of-way to the railroads, surrendering a large portion of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation to do so. The settlement grew slowly at first because of its location on the reservation. The opening of the reservation to settlement in 1902 provided impetus for development, and Pocatello became a prominent railway depot on the Union Pacific line between Omaha, Nebraska, and Portland, Oregon. Bearing the nickname “Gate City,” it developed as a processing and distribution centre for an irrigated agricultural area, with trucking augmenting rail freight transportation. The community expanded industrially with the acquisitions in the 1940s of a large naval ordnance plant and a phosphate reduction works. In 1962 it annexed Alameda.

Founded in 1834 by settlers from New York, it was originally known as McCarty’s Mills. A trading point and mill site near a Potawatomi Indian village, the town was laid out in 1836 and renamed Aurora in 1837. It developed as both a residential and an industrial city largely because of its key position along the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. In 1881 Aurora became the first city in Illinois to install electric streetlights.[P1]AuroraAurora, Illinois, on the Fox River.Cbradshaw[ML1]The city’s manufactures include heavy machinery, industrial and electrical equipment, woven cotton fabrics, timing products, rod end and spherical bearings, masonry accessories, and furniture.

Belleville’s economy was diversified, with coal mining and manufacturing (cooking and heating equipment) as the primary factors. Scott Air Force Base (1917) is just east and forms the basis of the city’s economy. Agriculture (corn [maize], soybeans, wheat, and livestock) is also important, and there is some manufacturing of appliances and space heaters. Belleville is the seat of Southwestern Illinois (community) College (1946). Local attractions include a historical museum, located in a Greek Revival-style home built in 1866; the (Roman Catholic) Cathedral of St. Peter, founded in 1842 and modeled after a church in Exeter, England; and Emma Kunz House Museum, located in a typical German “street house” built in 1830.

The area was settled in 1835 and was originally named Elysian Fields. The city was founded in 1836 and renamed Belvidere (Latin: “Beautiful View”). Belvidere was an important stopping place on the Chicago-Galena stage route and developed as an agricultural trading centre, shipping milk and grain to Chicago. The town centre was originally built north of the river but was moved to the other side after the railroad passed through there in 1851. Industries important to the local economy include machine tools, furnaces, automobiles, and canned and frozen vegetables. The surrounding agricultural area produces corn (maize), soybeans, and livestock. Some one-fifth of residents are Hispanic or Latino. Belvidere is notable for the colourful murals that adorn downtown buildings. The city also features the Boone County Historical Society Museum and, in Belvidere Cemetery, the Pettit Memorial Chapel (1907, restored 2003), designed by Frank Lloyd Wright; it is believed to be the only chapel Wright ever designed and is an early example of his trademark Prairie style.

Bridges over both rivers connect the city with Kentucky (east) and Missouri (west). Cairo was so named because its site was thought to resemble that of the Egyptian city (see Cairo), and southern Illinois consequently became known as Little Egypt.[P1]Confluence of the Mississippi (left) and Ohio rivers at Cairo, Illinois.© Alex S. MacLean/Landslides[ML1]Cairo and the Bank of Cairo were chartered in 1818, when there was no settlement and there were no depositors. A second and successful attempt at establishing a town was made in 1836–37 by the Cairo City and Canal Company, which built a large levee that encircled the city; however, the settlement collapsed in 1840. Cairo was visited in 1842 by Charles Dickens, who was not impressed and made it the prototype for the nightmare City of Eden in his novel Martin Chuzzlewit (1843–44). In 1846, 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of the site were purchased by the trustees of the Cairo City Property Trust, a group of Eastern investors who were interested in making the town the terminus of the projected Illinois Central Railroad; the railroad arrived in 1855. A city charter was obtained in 1857, and Cairo flourished as trade with Chicago spurred development. Cairo was headquarters for General Ulysses S. Grant during the western campaigns of the American Civil War. Grant’s presence forced much of the city’s trade to be diverted to Chicago. Cairo failed to regain much of the trade lost during the war, and agriculture and lumber and sawmills subsequently came to dominate the economy. The city was protected by its levees from destruction when the Ohio River rose to record heights during the 1937 flood. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Cairo was the scene of racial strife, and it fell into a serious decline thereafter.[P2]Local industries include the production of pulp and paper and the manufacture of polyurethane foam and pet products.

The area was first settled in the 1860s by Hans Johann Schrum, a German immigrant who produced maple syrup and potatoes on his lands and owned a pickle works. Beginning in the mid-1880s, the town attracted immigrants from Germany and Poland. It was incorporated as a village in 1893 and was called West Hammond until 1924 (Hammond, Indiana, is adjacent), when it was renamed for the waterways (calumet being the name of the peace pipe of the local Native Americans). It developed as a residential-industrial suburb of the Gary-Chicago metropolitan area. For decades beginning in the 1920s, the city’s nightclubs—most of them on State Street, known as “the strip”—and red-light district attracted notoriety as places of entertainment for conventioneers visiting Chicago and as havens for organized-crime figures such as Al Capone, earning the city its “Sin City” nickname and causing much municipal discord.

Indeed, a common notion for the origin of the city’s name is an Algonquian word for a wild leek (or onion) plant that grew locally. However, Chicago’s location at the southwestern end of the vast Great Lakes system could not have been more ideal as the country expanded westward in the 19th century, and perhaps this is reflected in another interpretation of the Native American term as meaning “strong” or “great.” Regardless of which derivation is correct, it was soon recognized that the Chicago River formed a critical link in the great waterway that arose mid-century between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River. With the rise of railways soon thereafter, the young city became the country’s railway hub, which helped diversify the city’s rapidly growing industrial base. Chicago continued as America’s crossroads with the explosive growth of air travel after World War II, which eased the city’s transition into a postindustrial economy.[P2]Chicago sprawls along the lakeshore and extends inland to meet its suburbs in a ragged line.

Chicago’s dizzying growth in the 19th century led to a reputation not only for disorder and political corruption but also for creativity in the arts, architecture, and business. The resulting economic opportunities also contributed to the diversity of the city’s population.[P4]High-rise apartment buildings of the Gold Coast neighbourhood in Chicago.Hisham F. Ibrahim/Getty Images[ML4] Chicago never fulfilled its dream of becoming the largest American city, but between 1890 and 1982 it was second only to New York City. That fact has contributed much to the city’s reputed personality. In the 19th century it had the image of being aggressive and self-promoting, stealing population and businesses from the East. Chicago’s “Windy City” nickname, in fact, came not from lake breezes but from its braggadocio—exhibited most dramatically in the 1890s, when it pushed aside New York and St. Louis, Mo., in the competition to become the site of the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893. Poet Carl Sandburg hailed it as the “city of the big shoulders,” cunning and cruel, yet creative and strangely attractive. It was the “toddlin’ town” of the 1920s tune, and Frank Sinatra famously proclaimed it “my kind of town.” New York writer A.J. Liebling belittled its provinciality in a stinging series of magazine articles, collected in the 1952 book Chicago: The Second City. Chicagoans eventually forgot the book, but the adopted epithet stuck. Under the regime of the late mayor Richard J. Daley, efficient municipal services made it the “city that works.” Chicagoans still like to refer to it as the “city of neighbourhoods,” even though that description can carry connotations of segregation by race, ethnicity, and social class.[P5] Few cities evoke as many contrasting pairs of images as Chicago. During the 19th century it was regarded as exceptional for the speed of its growth and the diversity of its population, yet its interior location supposedly made it a much more “typically American” city than New York. One-third of Chicago lay in ashes in the wake of the Great Fire of 1871, but it was rebuilt in record speed during the onset of an economic depression. It was the city of the humble immigrant and the new millionaire, the home of brazen criminals such as Al Capone and of great humanitarians such as settlement-house pioneer Jane Addams and child-welfare crusader Lucy Flower. There were raucous saloons under the watchful eye of temperance leader Frances Willard. Fetid wooden slums and horrific public housing high-rises have coexisted cheek by jowl with a uniquely innovative architectural tradition and the beautiful Gold Coast lakefront neighbourhood just north of the river. Chicago traditionally has been a shot-and-a-beer town whose best-known culinary inventions include a deep-dish pizza and a hot dog elaborately overloaded with garnishes. At the same time, it has long enjoyed a reputation for cutting-edge innovation in the arts, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra has maintained a high level of international renown.[P6] Chicago has been a stranger’s town throughout its history. Its position as a hub for rail and air travel has always meant that at any one time a large portion of the people in the city are out-of-towners. Over the years its location has fostered a lively convention trade—a fact that has led hundreds of organizations and corporations to call it home. As the metropolis of the country’s midsection, from the southern Great Plains to Canada and as far west as the Rocky Mountains, Chicago ranks among the country’s top tourist destinations. On any given day, the parking lots of its museums are filled with cars from dozens of surrounding states, while its varied retailers and wholesalers have long been an interstate and international magnet for shoppers.[P7] [H3]Landscape City site Chicago lies mainly on a relatively flat glacial plain—on what was once the bottom of Lake Chicago (the precursor of Lake Michigan)—averaging between 579 and 600 feet (176 and 183 metres) above sea level. Much of the site remained swampy, only a few feet above the lake level, before the central part of the city was filled in during the 19th century. Chicago is divided roughly into thirds by the North and South branches of the Chicago River, which join together about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the lake. The original meandering river mouth was straightened soon after the town’s founding, while a mile-long bend on the South Branch was eliminated to accommodate maritime traffic. A second important body of water, Lake Calumet, is located in the industrial southeastern part of the city; it is connected to the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal by the Calumet Sag (Cal-Sag) Channel and to Lake Michigan by the Calumet River.[P8]The Wrigley Building (left) and Tribune Tower (right centre) rise above the Chicago River in Chicago.© MedioImages/Getty Images[ML8] Downtown Chicago occupies the area between the lakeshore and the northern end of the South Branch and extends south from the river for a mile or so. Within this is the Loop, named in the 1880s for the square of blocks originally enclosed by streetcar tracks and now generally defined by the elevated tracks of the rapid-transit system. The Loop and the adjacent North Michigan Avenue corridor stretching north along the lakefront form the commercial and financial heart of the city.[P9] Climate Chicagoans have a pair of old adages about the local climate. The first—“If you don’t like the weather, wait an hour and it will change”—may have something to do with the fact that temperature and precipitation, borne by prairie winds from Iowa or Minnesota, routinely collide with conditions generated by Lake Michigan to produce abrupt weather alterations. The second—“There are two seasons in Chicago: Christmas and the Fourth of July”—refers to the sometimes stark extremes in the weather. About 50 °F (28 °C) separate the January average of 28 °F (−2 °C) and the July average of 75 °F (24 °C). The average annual precipitation is 35 inches (900 mm). Chicagoans can enjoy lying on the beach in summer and skating in the parks in winter.[P10] The expansive Chicago region, however, is large enough to see simultaneous double-digit differences in temperature. Although city pavements are known to absorb and radiate enough heat to affect local meteorological patterns, the lake often provides a moderating influence, slightly warming the areas near it in winter, cooling them in summer, and generating occasional lake-effect showers and snowfalls.[P11] City layout Chicago presents a different face in each direction. One of the city’s most attractive features is its miles of well-used parks and other public facilities along the lakeshore. Other parts of the city can be dismal. Sporadic industrial buildings, many of them abandoned, line the railroad routes and river branches that radiate out from the centre. The industrial landscape of the southeast portion of the city dominates the vista from the east. The western and northern approaches to Chicago present a vast expanse of tree-lined residential neighbourhoods, leading to a dramatic skyline of towering office, hotel, and apartment buildings that are concentrated downtown and along the lake.[P12]Chicago skyline at night.© rabbit75_fot/Fotolia[ML12] Thousands of tourists come each year just to view the architecture. The reconstruction of the city after the Great Fire of 1871 initiated a pattern of building innovation that expanded in the late 1880s with a wave of new office structures that were dubbed skyscrapers, a term reputedly coined in Chicago but which New York also claims. The steel frames of skyscrapers removed height limitations previously imposed by solid load-bearing masonry walls and allowed the use of large expanses of glass, terra-cotta facing, and other types of curtain walls. A generation of 1920s-era Art Deco office towers may be found principally in the LaSalle Street financial district, while the influence of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the German-born Chicago architect of great worldwide influence, can be seen in the 1950s–80s generation of International-style buildings. Scores of major structures have been constructed since the early 1970s. The 110-story, 1,450-foot (442-metre) Willis (formerly Sears) Tower (1974) remains one of the tallest in the world. Also ranking among the country’s tallest buildings are the 100-story John Hancock Center (1969), the 98-story Trump International Hotel and Tower (2009), the 83-story Aon Center (originally Amoco Building; 1974), the 61-story AT&T Corporate Center (1989), and the 65-story 311 South Wacker Building (1990). Dozens of newer postmodern designs continue to remake the skyline.[P13]The Merchandise Mart, Chicago.© Index OpenThe lobby of the Rookery (1886), a Chicago building designed by Daniel H.

In 1869, public health advocates, who called for Chicago to purify its air with a “green crown” of trees, joined with real estate interests to badger the state government into creating a ring of major parks linked together by broad boulevards. Growth led to a patchwork of neighbourhood green spaces. In 1934 the city consolidated 22 smaller park administrations to create the Chicago Park District, which operates more than 500 parks covering some 7,000 acres (2,800 hectares). Beyond the city, county forest preserve districts and the federal government have set aside thousands of acres of natural woodlands and have re-created prairies.[P14] A major outdoor gallery for the people, the city’s parks and public plazas feature dozens of monuments and sculptures. Nineteenth-century works in bronze honour such figures as Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant; immigrants have commemorated heroes and cultural figures including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Hans Christian Andersen. The philanthropist Kate Sturges Buckingham donated one of the world’s largest fountains—Clarence Buckingham Memorial Fountain (dedicated 1927), which graces Grant Park just east of downtown. Beginning in the 1960s, Chicago acquired contemporary sculptures by Alexander Calder, Claes Oldenburg, Henry Moore, Marc Chagall, Richard Hunt, and others. The most famous is the Pablo Picasso sculpture in Daley Center Plaza, fabricated of steel designed to weather and once described by an unappreciative alderman as “six stories of rusting boiler-plate.”[P15] Like all cities, Chicago is still deeply affected by the physical artifacts of its history. The street pattern is basically an extension of the first city plan of 1830. It is a grid layout, eight blocks to a mile, with major commercial streets around the perimeters of each square mile (2.5 square km). Not all streets conform, some having evolved from meandering Native American trails radiating outward from the river mouth and others having paths determined by the presence of the river and the lake.[P16] Chicago can perhaps be thought of as a fragmented city, with the river branches, major streets, railroad embankments, and (more recently) expressways dividing it into a diversity of neighbourhoods and housing types. There are lakefront high-rises, including Lake Point Tower—once among the tallest apartment buildings in the country and now only one of many such structures in its increasingly fashionable district east of Michigan Avenue—in sharp contrast to thousands of smaller stone-front or brick flats farther inland. Constantly improving public transportation and seemingly unlimited supplies of affordable land have long made single-family housing in the city relatively attainable for many. Outlying neighbourhoods still consist of tens of thousands of bungalows, built narrow and deep to fit city lots. Many of these homes were built in massive subdivisions where developers replicated the same basic house dozens of times.[P17] Chicago sprawls in all directions from the curving lakefront. The vast public-transportation and expressway networks have allowed the metropolitan area, popularly called Chicagoland, to stretch from Kenosha, Wis., around the south end of the lake through northwestern Indiana to the Michigan state line. Early suburban development gave the appearance of a wagon wheel. On the outer rim is a broad arc of older industrial cities—Waukegan, Elgin, St. Charles, Geneva, Aurora, Joliet, and Chicago Heights—that were once independent of Chicago; these cities formed part of a ring that informally defined the outer boundary of the metropolitan area until the latter part of the 20th century. Immediately surrounding the city are such communities as Evanston, Oak Park, Cicero, and Blue Island, all of which resisted annexation by their larger neighbour. Connecting the hub and rim are a number of other older residential suburbs that developed as part of spokelike strings of towns extending outward from the city along several commuter rail lines. The wheel pattern gradually broke down after World War II, when automobile commuting on a growing network of expressways allowed new subdivisions to displace the farms that lay between the spokes of the older rail-commuting suburbs. After 1960 the presence of O’Hare International Airport spurred businesses and light industry to concentrate in the northwest suburbs. New high-technology research facilities and offices developed after 1970 along the “Silicon Prairie” corridor stretching west of the city. As a result, the formerly quiet village of Naperville has been transformed into a sprawling “technoburb” with one of the largest populations in the state. Conversely, some of the older suburbs have replicated the inner-city pattern of aging structures, obsolete industrial buildings, and social problems, while the outward shift of jobs has accelerated the dispersal of residential development far beyond the ring of old industrial towns.[P18] [H4]People The most important fact about Chicago’s population is its historic and rich diversity. Early Chicago was inhabited by the Sauk (or Sac), Fox, and Potawatomi peoples, and the first permanent nonnative resident, Jean-Baptist-Point Du Sable (or DuSable), was of French-African heritage by way of the West Indies. French Canadian traders mixed with settlers from New England and the Middle Atlantic states. Irish, German, and Scandinavian immigrants began to pour in during the 1840s. In 1850 more than half of the population was foreign-born. During the latter half of the 19th century, arrivals from Italy, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Greece, Lithuania, Bohemia, China, and smaller countries entered the city through diverse portal neighbourhoods that were located just northwest and southwest of downtown. As they moved outward, they created communities that were virtually self-contained enclaves of commercial, social, and cultural activity. Elaborate churches and synagogues, many of which still survive, were often the centre of their lives.[P19] Race became a divisive issue after the turn of the 20th century. Job opportunities during World War I and restrictions on foreign immigration after 1924 lured tens of thousands of African Americans from the South. These new arrivals poured into a community on the city’s South Side that had existed since the mid-19th century. Soon dubbed Bronzeville, it became a centre of vibrant African American culture, amusement, and entrepreneurship. Mounting racial tensions, exacerbated by overcrowded and segregated housing on the South Side and the return of former soldiers, exploded in July 1919 into one of the country’s worst race riots, which claimed 38 lives. Meanwhile, Mexican Americans, who had responded to the same wartime opportunities and who were exempt from the 1924 legislation, came by the thousands, attracted by jobs in railroading, steel, and meatpacking. The Great Depression of the 1930s effectively halted the city’s growth, but World War II again attracted thousands of African Americans to work in defense plants and initiated a new wave of migration that grew rapidly during the 1950s. Refugees from Lithuania, Poland, and other eastern European countries also arrived after the war, as did newcomers from the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. At the same time, a thriving Japanese American community sprang from the relocation of workers from wartime internment camps to Chicago.[P20] Since the latter part of the 20th century, the city’s population growth has been fueled by migrants from both around the country and around the world. By the early 21st century, African Americans made up roughly one-third of the population, and whites constituted some two-fifths. Mexican Americans, whose numbers have mushroomed faster than those of any other group, have settled in a corridor extending southwestward from the Pilsen and Little Village neighbourhoods near downtown to suburban Cicero. They have been joined by others from every country in Central and South America. African immigrants have come from all regions of that continent. Hispanics now make up a growing one-fourth of the city’s population. The relaxation of immigration restrictions in the mid-1960s brought a substantial wave into the South Asian community, making Devon Avenue on the far North Side its arrival portal and main shopping street. There sari stores coexist with Jewish delis, Russian bookstores, and Palestinian markets. Meanwhile, Korean Americans also have prospered in small businesses scattered across the city. In 1975, arrivals following the Vietnam War created an instant neighbourhood centred near the lake on Argyle Street, where Cambodians, Thai, Hmong, and other Southeast Asians leaving their homelands have found opportunity.[P21] Change has been a constant factor in the ethnic and neighbourhood makeup of the city, forcing many groups to struggle to maintain their communities. Urban renewal for expressways and public housing was the major destabilizing factor during the 1950s and ’60s, notably for African Americans and Puerto Ricans. The loss of industrial jobs also devastated neighbourhoods, while chain stores drew money out of local circulation. Federal home loans—which restricted where and how funds could be spent—along with increased capacity on commuter rail lines and new expressway construction encouraged the post-World War II generations to build new homes in the suburbs, leaving behind aging parents in declining city neighbourhoods. In many areas the thousands of bungalows that had been built in a relatively short period of time all started to deteriorate. Without new housing stock to replace decaying structures, the downward cycle toward abandonment began in many areas of the South and West sides. The departing families were replaced by newly arrived minorities, whose poverty and race were disadvantages in an increasingly segregated city.[P22] The destruction of the old housing stock produced a loss of population, which led to the closing of such community anchors as churches, schools, and hospitals. Politicians and planners tried to contain the African American communities by constructing expressways around those areas and concentrating the residents of minority neighbourhoods in rows of monolithic public-housing high-rise apartment buildings. The Robert Taylor Homes near the lakefront on the South Side was the largest such project ever built in the country.[P23] The most recent destabilizing factor in some areas of the city has been gentrification. Conveniently located old houses and apartment buildings have lured enough financing to transform once-abandoned districts into communities of upscale housing units. Since the last decades of the 20th century, thousands of new residents have moved into the light-manufacturing belt surrounding the Loop. Where immigrant workers once carried their lunch pails to work in factories, these young urban professionals clutch briefcases and talk on their cell phones as they walk to work in downtown office towers. Similar developments are transforming the housing and manufacturing districts along several rapid-transit (popularly, “L,” for “elevated”) lines and in parts of the traditionally African American communities along the south shore of the lake. Boutiques and coffeehouses have displaced small grocers and other marginal merchants. While the process has saved neighbourhoods in one sense and brought back large numbers of affluent residents to the city, it has also tended to increase property values and tax assessments to the point where longtime residents of more-modest means are displaced. Indeed, many of the 1960s-era public-housing projects (including Robert Taylor) have now been razed, although some provisions have been made for housing the former tenants.[P24] Page 1 of 3 Next page Economy
Illinois"Chicago Heights"City"Cook county"northeastern Illinois"Chicago Heights, city, Cook county, northeastern Illinois, U.S. It is a suburb of Chicago, about 30 miles (50 km) south of downtown. The city’s name derives from its proximity to Chicago and its elevation, which averages 95 feet (29 metres) above the surrounding area. The site was the intersection of two trails, the Hubbard (from Vincennes, Indiana, to Fort Dearborn on the Chicago River) and the Sauk (used by Native Americans going from their hunting grounds to the fur post at Detroit, Michigan). Settled by Scotch-Irish in the 1830s and known as Thorn Grove, it was renamed Bloom in 1849 by German immigrants to honour a German patriot executed in 1848 in Vienna. It was given its present name at its incorporation as a village in 1892. In the late 19th century the city was settled by large numbers of Italian immigrants. The Chicago Heights Land Association induced manufacturers to establish factories there, drawing immigrants from throughout Europe. Chicago Heights was the earliest and, for a time, the most important of the steel-making communities in the Chicago area. The city’s manufactures are now highly diversified; in addition to steel, manufactures include automobile-body stampings, railroad freight cars, automotive parts, and chemicals. The city is the seat of Prairie State (community) College (founded in 1957 as Bloom Township Community College). Inc. city, 1901. Pop. (2000) 32,776; (2010) 30,276.[P1] [END-OF-CONTENT]

It was named for the Roman statesman (see Cicero). Cicero’s development was stimulated when the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad was built through the site (1864) and by the arrival of land speculators and farmers after the American Civil War. Economic growth continued, but Cicero lost territory to Chicago and to the formation (1901) of Berwyn and Oak Park. In the 1920s gangster Al Capone left Chicago for several years and made Cicero his base of operations, taking control of the town’s government and elections and running speakeasies, brothels, and gambling halls. The town developed as a manufacturing centre. Cicero’s economy is based on manufacturing, including appliance and machinery parts, steel, metal products, glass, and packaging. The town is the seat of Morton (junior) College (1924). There is horse racing at Hawthorne Race Course. Inc. 1867. Pop. (2000) 85,616; (2010) 83,891.[P1] [END-OF-CONTENT]
Illinois"Collinsville"City"Clair counties"southwestern Illinois"Collinsville, city, Madison and St. Clair counties, southwestern Illinois, U.S. It lies a few miles east of the Mississippi River, opposite St. Louis, Missouri. First settled in 1810 by John Cook of Virginia, the community was laid out in 1837 on bluffs above the river’s floodplain. The village was originally named Unionville but was soon renamed Collinsville for an early pioneer family that had bought Cook’s claim in 1818. Once a bituminous-coal mining centre (the first mine was sunk in 1870), the area also had lead and zinc mines and a cowbell factory. Collinsville is now mainly residential, and the economy is based on government services, Fairmount Park (a horse racing facility), retail, and clothing manufacturing. It is also a centre of horseradish production; an annual horseradish festival is held in June. A notable local attraction is the “World’s Largest Catsup Bottle” (built 1949), which stands 170 feet (52 metres) high.

Early inhabitants of the area included Miami, Kickapoo, and Potawatomi Indians, and a number of trails passed through or terminated there. The location of salt deposits a few miles west of the village provided the primary incentive for early settlement. Shortly after Vermilion county was organized in 1826, Dan Beckwith and Guy W. Smith, two early settlers who were interested in the saltworks, offered to donate a tract of land for a county seat. The offer was accepted, and the new county seat was named Danville in honour of Beckwith. Abraham Lincoln practiced law in the city in the 1840s and ’50s.[P1]The area was formerly a coal-mining centre, and a few mines remain in operation. Danville’s economy is based on agriculture (especially corn [maize] and soybeans) and diversified industry, notably metal products, heavy machinery, food processing, packaging, and heat transfer equipment. The city is the seat of Danville Area Community College (1946). The Vermilion County Museum contains Lincoln memorabilia. Also notable is the World War I Victory Memorial (1922), sculpted by Lorado Taft.

First settled in 1820, the town was founded in 1829 and was named for the American naval hero Stephen Decatur. Abraham Lincoln, migrating with his family from Indiana, lived for a year (1830–31) near the city; Lincoln’s first political speech was delivered in what is now downtown Lincoln Square, and he was formally endorsed as a candidate for the presidency of the United States by the Republican state convention in Decatur (May 9, 1860). Decatur’s economy was originally based on agriculture, but the city grew as an industrial centre with the arrival of the railroad in 1854. The first post of the Grand Army of the Republic (an American Civil War veterans’ organization) was established in Decatur (April 6, 1866). In 1920 George Halas founded the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and helped found the American Professional Football Association (now the National Football League). In 1922 the city became a centre of soybean production when the first major commercial production plant was opened there. With the establishment of other soybean processing plants, the city became known as the “Soybean Capital of the World.”[P1]Decatur: Millikin UniversityShilling Hall, Millikin University, Decatur, Illinois.Paris25[ML1]Decatur is an important commercial, agricultural, and distribution centre, with large corn (maize) and soybean processing plants and varied industries, including the manufacture of construction and mining equipment, iron castings, control valves, automotive parts, glass, electric motors and generators, and pharmaceuticals.

The city grew with the arrival of the railroad in the 1850s, and agriculture was the primary activity. DeKalb’s development was attributed to the barbed-wire industry established there by Joseph F. Glidden, who in 1874 invented a successful variety of barbed-wire fencing; his invention earned DeKalb the nickname “Barb City.” The DeKalb County Farm Bureau, the first organization of its kind in the United States, was organized there in 1912.

Illinois"East Saint Louis"City"Clair county"southwestern Illinois"East Saint Louis, city, St. Clair county, southwestern Illinois, U.S. It lies along the Mississippi River opposite St. Louis, Missouri. About 1797 a ferry station was established on the site by Captain James Piggott, a pioneer and Illinois territorial judge, and in 1818 a village was laid out. Originally known as Illinoistown, it was destroyed by flooding in 1844 and later rebuilt. Illinoistown was incorporated in 1859, and two years later it was renamed East St. Louis. Beginning with barge traffic down the Mississippi and continuing with the arrival of the first railroad (1855) and the building of the Eads Bridge (1874) across the river, the city developed as a transportation centre. Nearby coal deposits also contributed to East St. Louis’s growth. Meatpacking became a major industry after the opening of the National Stock Yards (1873) in adjoining National City, and manufacturing industries began to arrive in large numbers. The employment of African American workers in a factory during World War I led to the East St. Louis Race Riot of 1917, one of the worst incidents of racial violence in the United States during the war.[P1]By the early 20th century the city’s industrial activities included oil refining and the manufacture of aluminum, chemicals, pigments, steel products, glass, and building materials. East St. Louis was hard hit by the Great Depression, recovered briefly during World War II, and then began to suffer a decline, as the need for the city’s coal, rail transport facilities, and regional meatpacking centre was dramatically reduced. Changes in the city’s ethnic composition (some three-fifths of the city’s residents were white in 1950, but they now constitute only a tiny fraction of the population) were accompanied by a loss of industry and population (the city’s population declined by more than three-fifths between 1950 and 2000), a decline in city services, and economic impoverishment. East St. Louis’s economy continued to decline until the 1990s, when the opening of a riverboat casino brought some employment and revenue. Other redevelopment projects were begun in the late 1990s. A notable local attraction is a museum (opened 1977) dedicated to the life and career of dancer Katherine Dunham, featuring a children’s workshop.

In 1838 a dam was built on the river, and soon several mills were in operation. Following the arrival of a railway link in 1850, Elgin quickly became a major dairy-producing centre; by the 1920s, however, the industry had declined dramatically. In 1865 the Elgin Milk Condensing Company was opened by Gail Borden; it was closed in 1918.

Settled in 1836, it was originally called Cottage Hill for the Hill Cottage, an inn built in 1843 midway between Chicago and the Fox Valley settlement. In 1869 it was renamed Elmhurst for the elm trees that had been planted along its streets. The Galena and Chicago Union Railroad (now part of the Union Pacific Railroad system) arrived in 1849, providing access to Chicago for the community’s produce. Elmhurst remained a farming community until the 1930s, after which it developed as a residential suburb of Chicago. Food processing, the manufacture of industrial supplies, and financial and health care services contribute to the city’s economy.

Illinois"Evanston"City"Cook county"northeastern Illinois"Evanston, city, Cook county, northeastern Illinois, U.S. It lies on Lake Michigan, 13 miles (21 km) north of downtown Chicago. Illinois and later Potawatomi Indians were early inhabitants of the area. French explorers passed through the area in the 17th century and called it Grosse Pointe. In a series of treaties between 1795 and 1833, the Potawatomi ceded their lands to the United States. American settlement began in 1836 when Major Edward H. Mulford, a jewelry dealer from New York, built a tavern at the site. In 1850 the community was renamed Ridgeville. A group of Chicago businessmen purchased property along the lakeshore for Northwestern University in 1853 under a special state charter of 1851. The city grew up around the university and was renamed (1857) for physician John Evans, one of Northwestern’s founders. An amendment in Northwestern’s charter prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages in Evanston from 1853 until 1972. The city annexed adjoining North Evanston in 1874 and South Evanston in 1892. The university has expanded on landfill.[P1]Alice S. Millar Chapel and Religious Center, Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill.© Michael Levy[ML1]Evanston is noted as an educational and religious centre.

Pennsylvania Germans began arriving in the area in the late 1820s. The town was founded in 1835 by trader William (“Tutty”) Baker and settled by unsuccessful miners from the Galena lead-mining district, about 40 miles (65 km) west. Baker established a free ferry service across the river and provided free meals and accommodations to travelers, and the settlement (called Winneshiek) subsequently became known as “Free Port” in honour of his generosity. With the arrival of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad (1853), followed by the Illinois Central and Racine and Mississippi railroads, Freeport developed as an industrial and agricultural centre. Its economic base still includes agriculture (especially dairying, corn [maize], and livestock); also important are manufacturing (including electronic sensors, tires, window treatments, machine components, and snack foods) and a sizable insurance industry. Since the late 1860s Freeport has been known for its pretzels, which have earned it the nickname “Pretzel City USA.”[P1]Freeport: Civil War Soldiers Monument and Stephenson County Courthouse The Civil War Soldiers Monument (left) and the Stephenson County Courthouse, Freeport, Ill.IvoShandor[ML1]On August 27, 1858, Freeport was the site of the second Lincoln-Douglas debate, during which Stephen A.

French explorers visited the region in the late 17th century and found Sauk and Fox Indians mining lead. In 1807 the U.S. Congress created a lead-mining district, and the area soon became an active mining centre. A trading post was established in 1819, and in 1826 the city was laid out and named Galena for the lead deposits. Galena soon became one of the busiest ports on the Mississippi River, its population swelling to about 14,000. The post office, constructed of limestone and completed in 1857, is the second oldest continuously used postal facility in the United States.

Illinois and later Potawatomi Indians were early inhabitants of the area, which was visited by French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet in 1673. Glenview Road follows a Native American trail leading from the Des Plaines River to Lake Michigan. The Native American peoples gradually ceded their lands, and through the Treaty of Chicago (1833) they surrendered their final claims to lands in northern Illinois. Settlement began in 1833, and the community was first named South Northfield. It was later known as North Branch, Oak Glen, and Hutchings before adopting its present name in 1895. Development of the village, which was originally an agricultural centre, was stimulated by the establishment in 1940 of the Glenview Naval Air Station (closed 1995). Glenview is now primarily residential, though it has some light industry, notably publishing, food processing, and toolmaking.

The country’s coal fields were closed by strikes, and, when a mining company attempted to operate a strip mine with nonunion labour, several hundred striking union miners forced the nonunion workers to surrender and promised them safe conduct. After being marched to a point near Herrin, the captives were ordered to run for their lives under fire; some 20 people were killed, and others were wounded. Although a grand jury returned numerous indictments for murder and other offenses, all of the defendants were acquitted. Also during the 1920s, Herrin suffered violence related to bootlegging and the Ku Klux Klan, helping the county earn the notorious nickname “Bloody Williamson.”[P1]There is still some coal mining in the area, but Herrin’s economy now relies on the production of washing machines and dryers, military weapons and ammunition, packaging, fasteners, and nailing and stapling machines.

Illinois"Kaskaskia"Village"Randolph county"southwestern Illinois"Kaskaskia, village, Randolph county, southwestern Illinois, U.S. It is situated on Kaskaskia Island in the Mississippi River, just west of Chester. Kaskaskia Island is the only portion of Illinois located west of the Mississippi River. Illinois and Iroquois Indians were early inhabitants of the area; the village is named for one of the tribes of the Illinois confederation. The original settlement (now underwater) was founded in 1703 as a Jesuit mission and developed as a French trading post and a farming community. Initially incorporated as a town by the French in 1725, it was granted special rights by King Louis XV of France. French-built Fort Kaskaskia (1733) was destroyed in 1766 by villagers when the British occupied the region. In 1778 George Rogers Clark captured it for the United States. Kaskaskia became the capital of the Illinois Territory in 1809; after Illinois achieved statehood, Kaskaskia briefly served as the state capital (1818–20) until the administrative centre was transferred to Vandalia. The original village (incorporated 1818) was, beginning in 1844, gradually inundated as the Mississippi River changed its course, creating the island. The island was completely cut off from the mainland with the great flood of 1881, and by the early 20th century the remainder of the original settlement had disappeared.

Illinois"Kewanee"City"Henry county"northwestern Illinois"Kewanee, city, Henry county, northwestern Illinois, U.S. It lies about 45 miles (70 km) northwest of Peoria. Potawatomi, Winnebago, Sauk, and Fox Indians were early inhabitants of the area. Kewanee was laid out in 1854 in anticipation of the arrival of the railroad. Some of the early inhabitants desired that the settlement be named Berrien, in honour of the engineer who built the railroad, but the engineer instead suggested Kewanee, a Winnebago word meaning “Prairie Chicken” (then plentiful in the area). In 1924 Kewanee absorbed the nearby community of Wethersfield (founded 1836), which had declined when it was bypassed by the railroad. The local economy is based on agriculture (notably hogs) and manufacturing (heating equipment, heavy machinery, doors and windows, truck trailers, and leather apparel). Black Hawk (community) College–East Campus was established south of Kewanee in 1967. Designated the “Hog Capital of the World” by the Illinois state legislature in 1948, Kewanee hosts an annual hog festival (over Labor Day weekend). Johnson–Sauk Trail State Park is north of the city.

With Peru (adjacent to the west) and Oglesby (southeast), La Salle forms a tri-city unit. The city was named for the French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, sieur (lord) de La Salle, who built a fort nearby in 1682. Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet had passed through the area, then inhabited by Illinois Indians, in 1673. Founded in 1827, La Salle grew with the completion of the Illinois and Michigan Canal (1848) and the arrival in the 1850s of the Illinois Central and Rock Island railroads. La Salle’s economy, formerly centred on coal mining and zinc, now depends largely on agriculture (primarily corn [maize] and soybeans), distribution, and the manufacture of chemicals and transmissions. Illinois Valley Community College (1924) is in Oglesby. The Hegeler-Carus Mansion (1874), built by Edward C. Hegeler (a partner in the Matthiessen and Hegeler Zinc Company), is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Starved Rock, Buffalo Rock, and Matthiessen state parks are nearby.

With East Moline and Rock Island, Illinois, and Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa, it forms a complex known as the Quad Cities. Sauk and Fox Indians inhabited the area at the time of the first settlement; conflicts over territory led to the Black Hawk War (1832). The site was laid out in 1843 by a group of settlers engaged in milling operations. Its name is apparently from the French moulin (“mill”). After the American Civil War, Swedish and Belgian immigrants arrived. John Deere, inventor of an improved steel plow, established a workshop there in 1848, and Moline was soon a centre of plow production. The city, once called “Plow City,” remains the world headquarters for John Deere, and farm implements continue to be the primary economic factor in Moline. Aluminum and elevators are also produced, and food processing and the military (at the nearby Rock Island Arsenal) are important to the local economy as well. Moline is the seat of Black Hawk (community) College (1946); there is also a campus of Western Illinois University. The John Deere Pavilion (1997) includes exhibits on agriculture and displays of modern and vintage farm equipment. The company’s administrative centre (1963) was designed by Eero Saarinen.

When the city was originally to be named, three potential names (Kosciusko, Isabella, and Monmouth) were placed in a hat. Kosciusko, for Polish officer Tadeusz Kościusko (who gained fame for his role assisting American forces during the Revolution), was drawn, but residents decided the name was too difficult to spell, and it was withdrawn; Monmouth was subsequently drawn.

Founded in 1819, it was initially to be named Mount Pleasant but, after intense debate, was named instead for George Washington’s home (see Mount Vernon) in Virginia. The Illinois Supreme Court was located in Mount Vernon (1856–96), and Abraham Lincoln argued and won a tax case there in 1859. A railway link (1872) spurred industrial development, with the establishment of mills, foundries, and breweries. In 1888 Mount Vernon was devastated by a tornado that destroyed some 500 buildings, but the city was quickly rebuilt. During the first half of the 20th century, Mount Vernon was a major producer of railroad cars. The city is now an agricultural (soybeans) and distribution centre, and coal mining, oil production, and tire manufacturing contribute to the local economy. Local varieties of wines are also produced.

The area was long inhabited by Sauk and Fox Indians before American settlement. Permanent settlement was begun in 1824 by Captain James White, and the area soon became known as Venus. In 1834 it was renamed Commerce, and two years later the city was laid out, though in 1837 much of the area was abandoned. Nauvoo played an important role in Illinois history during the Mormon era. The Mormons arrived in 1839, and their leader, Joseph Smith, renamed the settlement Nauvoo (a Hebrew word signifying “Beautiful Place”). It subsequently grew as a Mormon community of as many as 20,000 (making it then one of the largest cities in the state). In 1846, two years after a mob murdered Smith and his brother at the jail in nearby Carthage, Brigham Young led the Mormons on an exodus to Utah. In 1849 the area was settled by Icarians, a group of socialists chiefly of French origin led by Étienne Cabet, who were joined by German and Swiss immigrants. By the mid-1850s there were divisions within the commune, and many Icarians left Nauvoo. From the mid-1860s Nauvoo became a centre for the cultivation of grapes; the local economy was devastated by Prohibition (1919–33). In the 1930s blue-cheese making was introduced and became a chief source of income until the early 21st century.

It was founded in the early 1850s at the intersection of the Illinois Central and Chicago and Alton railroads and was initially called North Bloomington (or “The Junction”). In 1857 the Illinois legislature passed a law that called for establishing a normal (teacher-training) school in the locale that offered the best financial arrangement. North Bloomington’s citizens and businesses subsequently were successful in raising funds, and attorney Abraham Lincoln drafted a bond to ensure that the town would meet its financial obligations. That year Illinois State Normal University (now Illinois State University) was established, and in 1867 the town was incorporated and renamed Normal. The local economy is based on the university and agriculture. Normal is situated in the state’s richest corn (maize) and soybean producing area.

The first of the seven Lincoln-Douglas debates was held in Ottawa in August 1858. Coal mining was important until the 1920s.[P1]Ottawa is situated in a rich agricultural area (primarily corn [maize] and soybeans). Manufactures include plastics, glass, and automotive parts. Silica sand is also produced. The city features a memorial dedicated to W.D. Boyce, founder of the Boy Scouts of America, and a scouting museum. Illini, Buffalo Rock, Starved Rock, and Matthiessen state parks and LaSalle Lake State Fish and Wildlife Area are nearby. Ottawa lies along the Illinois and Michigan Canal State Trail and is part of the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor. Inc. village, 1837; city, 1853. Pop.

French explorers wintered in the area in 1680. The first settler was Jonathan Tharp in 1824. Tharp opened a smokehouse in 1827, and in 1829 the town was laid out and named Pekin by the wife of Nathan Cromwell, one of the city’s founders, for Peking (Beijing), China. Pekin’s first schoolhouse (Snell School) was opened in 1831 and fortified during the Black Hawk War (1832) as Fort Doolittle. Pekin’s economy was for many years based on the steamboat trade. Abraham Lincoln argued many cases in its courthouse, as did Stephen A. Douglas and David Davis. The city was the birthplace and home of U.S. Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen, who is buried there.[P1]Pekin is served by several railroads and is on the Illinois Waterway. The city’s economy is based on agriculture (corn [maize], soybeans, and livestock), a federal prison, insurance, and manufacturing (including food products, alcohol, liquor, medical equipment, and heavy machinery). The Marigold Festival is held annually in September; Pekin’s Winter Wonderland attracts visitors from around the region.

With Peoria Heights, West Peoria, Bartonville, Bellevue, East Peoria, Creve Coeur, Marquette Heights, North Pekin, and Pekin, Peoria forms an urbanized industrial complex.[P1]Bradley UniversityBradley Hall, Bradley University, Peoria, Ill.AscendedAnathema[ML1]The city is named for the Peoria Indians, one of the five tribes in the Illinois confederacy, who had long inhabited the area before European settlement. Peoria is one of the state’s oldest settled locations. The French under René-Robert Cavelier, sieur (lord) de La Salle, built Fort Crèvecoeur (“Broken Heart”) on the river bluffs opposite the present city in 1680, but the fort was plundered and deserted later that same year. A decade later the French military, with the assistance of the Illinois Indians, built a large fortification known as Fort Pimiteoui. Other settlements around Peoria Lake, established by the French, Native Americans, and later colonists, followed. Native American and French influence remained until about 1812, when much of the village was burned by U.S. troops and its French residents were transferred to other locations, notably Alton. The following year Fort Clark was built and named for George Rogers Clark, a general in the American Revolution. Settlement began in 1819, and in 1825 it became the county seat. There, on October 16, 1854, in an event preceding the famed Lincoln-Douglas debates, Abraham Lincoln denounced slavery in rebuttal to a speech by Stephen A. Douglas.[P2]A major port on the Illinois River, Peoria is a trading and shipping centre for a large agricultural area that produces corn (maize), soybeans, and livestock. The economy is well diversified, but the city’s traditional manufacturing industries are still important and make earthmoving equipment, metal products, lawn-care equipment, labels, steel towers, farm equipment, building materials, steel, wire, and chemicals. Caterpillar Inc., a heavy-machinery company and the city’s largest employer, has its international headquarters there. The city was once home to many distilleries and breweries, but the last such plants were closed in the 1980s. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research (completed 1940) is located in Peoria. Educational institutions include Bradley University (1897), Midstate College (1888), and Illinois Central College (1967), in East Peoria. Peoria was made famous by an old vaudeville line—“Will it play in Peoria?”—that suggested the city was a bellwether for “heartland” values of the entire country. Peoria’s cultural and recreational facilities include the Civic Center (1982), which hosts music concerts, exhibitions, and other events; Lakeview Park contains the Lakeview Museum of Arts and Sciences, Peoria Players Theatre, a swimming pool, and an ice-skating rink. The city also features opera and ballet companies, a symphony orchestra, several theatre organizations, and a zoo. Riverfront developments in the late 1980s and ’90s included riverboat gambling and have stimulated the local tourist trade.

Sauk, Fox, and Kickapoo Indians were early inhabitants of the area. Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet stopped at what would become Quincy in 1673 during their exploration along the Mississippi River. The area was settled in 1822 by New Yorker John Wood (12th governor of Illinois, 1860–61). First known as Bluffs, it became the county seat on March 4, 1825, the day that President John Quincy Adams was inaugurated, and was renamed in Adams’s honour. During the winter of 1838–39, Mormons found refuge there before proceeding northward along the river to Nauvoo. The city received an influx of German immigrants in the 1840s. Quincy grew rapidly as a river town with the increase in steamboat traffic in the 1850s and became an important shipping point and stop for travelers. Because of the city’s proximity to Missouri (a slave state), the issue of slavery created much political controversy. Quincy was a part of the Underground Railroad (a system by which slaves were assisted in escaping to the North and to Canada). The city declined with the passing of the steamboat era in the 1870s, but after 1920 industrial development stimulated its growth. Quincy’s economy is based on agriculture (including corn [maize], soybeans, and livestock) and manufacturing (including elevators, radio and television parts, air compressors, petroleum equipment, electronics, wheels, and truck bodies).[P1]Bayview Bridge Bayview Bridge over the Mississippi River at Quincy, Ill.MadMaxMarchHare[ML1]On October 13, 1858, Quincy’s Washington Park (originally John’s Square) was the site of the sixth of the Lincoln-Douglas debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A.

Settled with the arrival of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1854, it was named for Robert Rantoul, a director of the railroad. For much of the 20th century the economy was largely dependent on Chanute Air Force Base, adjacent to Rantoul. Built in 1917 and named for Octave Chanute (1832–1910), a pioneer in aviation engineering, it was one of the oldest and one of the largest technical-training centres of the U.S. Air Force. The base closed in 1993, and the following year the Octave Chanute Aerospace Museum was opened nearby.

With Moline and East Moline, Illinois, and Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa, Rock Island forms the Quad Cities complex. Sauk and Fox Indians inhabited the area at the time of the first American settlement. Fort Armstrong was built on the island in 1816 and was the headquarters of operations in the Black Hawk War (1832), in which Chief Black Hawk and his people were forced out of Illinois. Laid out in 1835 as Stephenson, the community was renamed Rock Island and incorporated as a town in 1841. In 1854 it was reached by the Rock Island Railroad, and it was there the Mississippi was first bridged (1856). The island was an American Civil War ordnance depot and served as a prisoner-of-war camp, where many Confederates died; Union and Confederate cemeteries are on the island. It is now occupied by the Rock Island Arsenal, which includes a military museum, the Colonel Davenport House (1833), and a replica of a Fort Armstrong blockhouse. Black Hawk State Historic Site, at the city’s southern edge, was once the site of large Sauk and Fox villages and of the Sauk capital; a museum is devoted to tribal life.[P1]The military dominates the local economy; health care and food processing are also important.

Waterpower supplied by a dam constructed in the mid-19th century led to the development of Rockford as a manufacturing centre in the middle of an agricultural area. The farm-machinery business began there in the early 1850s when John H. Manny developed a combined reaper and mower. The furniture industry began with an influx of Swedish carpenters, who arrived following the extension of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad to the Rock River (1852).

Ancient Native American burial mounds are located in the city, which was also the site of a Shawnee Indian village before American settlement at the beginning of the 19th century. The community was laid out in 1810 as a shipping point for the nearby salt springs. A land office was opened in 1812, and Shawneetown became the gateway to Illinois for settlers from the east, as well as a trading and financial centre.

Abraham Lincoln moved to Springfield from New Salem on April 15, 1837, and lived there until he became president in 1861. Springfield had a population of less than 3,000 when it was chosen as the state capital in 1837 (government offices moved to Springfield from Vandalia in 1839), largely through the efforts of Lincoln and eight other members of the Illinois legislature (known as the “Long Nine” because they were all over 6 feet [1.8 metres] tall).[P2]In the Old State Capitol (1837–53; rebuilt in the 1960s as a state historic site), Lincoln served his last term in the legislature (1840–41), practiced before the state Supreme Court, delivered his famous “House Divided” address, and maintained an office as president-elect. His body lay in state there (May 3 and 4, 1865), and there is a collection of Lincolniana in the historical library. Lincoln-Herndon Law Offices State Historic Site preserves the building where Lincoln practiced law from 1843 to about 1852.

The first permanent settlement in the area, established in the mid-19th century, was called Hardscrabble, for the difficult climb up from the river. It was known as Unionville after the American Civil War. Following the discovery of coal in the vicinity, the Vermillion Coal Company formed in 1866 and opened the first coal mine there. A new town site was planned shortly thereafter, and the town was renamed for Worthy Streator, president of the Vermillion Coal Company. The community also manufactured brick, drainage tiles, and glass, drawing on local deposits of clay, shale, and silica sand. The city’s economy is still primarily industrial (including food processing and distribution and the manufacture of glass containers and sewer-cleaning equipment) but is augmented by agriculture (corn [maize] and soybeans).

Illinois"Zion"City"Lake county"northeastern Illinois"Zion, city, Lake county, northeastern Illinois, U.S. It lies along Lake Michigan, near the Wisconsin border. The area was originally inhabited by Potawatomi Indians. Zion was founded in 1900 by John Alexander Dowie, an evangelist originally from Scotland, as the headquarters of his Christian Catholic Church (originally the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church). Dowie envisioned that the city, founded on principles of racial equality, would be run in accordance with Christian ethics. The massive 8,000-seat Shiloh Tabernacle was completed in 1900 and became Zion’s religious centre until it burned in 1937. Settlement began in 1901, and from its origins the city was theocratically governed, with the church controlling all business activities. With few exceptions, streets in the city were named for biblical figures. Financial difficulties eventually led to Dowie’s ouster as general overseer; his successor was Wilbur Glenn Voliva. In 1907 the city and the church were forced into bankruptcy, but over the next 15 years the church reacquired much of its prior holdings in the city. Voliva and the church remained in firm control of Zion until the mid-1930s, when Voliva was removed from power, and the city subsequently welcomed new churches and industry. The Christian Catholic Church schools were closed in 1939, after which a modern educational system was developed. Early industry included a lacework factory; the baking industry was also important. Zion is now primarily residential. A popular local event has been the performance of the Passion play, which has been organized since the 1930s by the Christian Catholic Church (now the Christ Community Church).

Indiana"Fort Wayne"City"Allen county"northeastern Indiana"Fort Wayne, city, seat (1824) of Allen county, northeastern Indiana, U.S., at the confluence of the St. Marys and St. Joseph rivers where they form the Maumee River, 121 miles (195 km) northeast of Indianapolis. The waters, spanned by 21 bridges, divide the city into three parts. The place was prominent in frontier history. In the late 17th century the French built a trading post (later fort) at this natural stronghold on the site of Kekionga (or Kiskakon), once the chief town of the Miami Indians. It was attacked and taken by the English (1760) and then by Miami and Ottawas under Pontiac (1763). A log stockade constructed in 1794 by General Anthony Wayne after the Battle of Fallen Timbers, near what is now Toledo, Ohio (reconstructed 1975), gave the town its name.[P1]Fort Wayne, Ind.: Foellinger-Freimann Botanical ConservatoryFoellinger-Freimann Botanical Conservatory, Fort Wayne, Ind.Indiana Tourism[ML1]Fort Wayne’s industrial growth began with the building of the Wabash and Erie Canal in the 1830s and was stimulated in the 1850s when the railway came. The city’s easy access to raw materials and markets has encouraged the manufacture of a wide range of vehicles; metal, plastic, and rubber products; machinery, including automotive and electrical equipment and parts; and tools and dies. Fort Wayne is noted as a centre of higher learning; its institutions include Concordia Theological Seminary (1846), Indiana Institute of Technology (1930), Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne (1917), and the University of St. Francis (1890). The Lincoln Library and Museum houses a large collection of Abraham Lincoln memorabilia. The Embassy Theatre (1928), a vaudeville and movie palace of mixed Spanish and Italianate design, hosts the city’s philharmonic orchestra, touring acts, and a film revival series; the theatre (including a rare Page theatre organ) and part of the adjacent Indiana Hotel (1928) were restored during the 1980s and ’90s. The Foellinger-Freimann Botanical Conservatory (1983) houses seasonal displays as well as desert and tropical plant collections in a passive-solar greenhouse.[P2]John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed), the pioneer orchard planter, is buried near the War Memorial Coliseum.

Indiana"French Lick"Town"Orange county"southern Indiana"French Lick, resort town, Orange county, southern Indiana, U.S. It lies 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Louisville, Kentucky, and is nearly encircled by Hoosier National Forest. Founded in 1811, the settlement was named for an 18th-century French trading post in the area and an animal (salt) lick within the town boundaries. The first hotel on the site was built in 1840 by William A. Bowles, who laid out the town in 1857. Thomas Taggart (1856–1929), three-time mayor of Indianapolis and later chairman of the Democratic National Committee, purchased the hotel in 1901 and was instrumental in French Lick’s development as a year-round health resort and convention centre. The French Lick Springs Hotel has spa facilities based on water with high mineral content from nearby artesian springs. At West Baden Springs, a mile north, is a former grand resort hotel (built 1901–03). From 1966 to 1983 it housed Northwood Institute, a business college; it was subsequently renovated for its original use. Basketball star Larry Bird is a French Lick native. Inc. 1857. Pop.

Indiana"Gary"City"Lake county"extreme northwest Indiana"Gary, city, Lake county, extreme northwest Indiana, U.S. It lies at the southern end of Lake Michigan, east of Chicago. In 1906 the town—named for Elbert H. Gary, chief organizer of the United States Steel Corporation—was laid out as an adjunct of the company’s vast new manufacturing complex. The site was chosen because it lay on navigable water midway between the iron ore beds to the north and the coal region to the south. Large areas were drained, sand dunes removed, and a meandering river rerouted. Steelworks were then built along the lakeshore, with the town to the south. The Gary Land Company, a U.S. Steel subsidiary, laid out its part of the town, constructed the streets and sidewalks, installed the sewage system, and built the waterworks and electric plant. The first ore boat arrived on July 23, 1908, and steel production began early the following year. Although Gary has some diversified manufacturing (petroleum products, chemicals, fabricated metal and machinery), it is essentially a one-industry city and has periodically suffered from declines in steel production and labour disputes. During World War I a sizable number of African Americans moved north to work in Gary, and by the 1930s they constituted one-sixth of Gary’s population. World War II drew many more, and in 1967 Richard G. Hatcher became one of the first African Americans to be elected mayor of a major U.S. city. Gary was the scene of a significant early-20th-century development in public education when William Wirt established the work-study-play school, popularly known as the platoon school, designed to attract underprivileged children. The city has experienced a significant economic decline since the 1960s. Manufacturing slumped overall, and employment at the USX (formerly U.S. Steel) Gary Works fell from more than 20,000 at midcentury to some 7,500 at century’s end; many other businesses closed as a result. Racial tensions also affected the city. A new civic centre in Gary’s downtown area was completed in the early 1980s, and by the early 21st century a number of other efforts to revitalize the city were under way.

A rural community with many Old Order Amish and Swiss Mennonite families, it lies in the “Limberlost Country,” a timber swampland made famous by the naturalist and novelist Gene Stratton Porter in novels such as Freckles (1904) and A Girl of the Limberlost (1909). The swampland was drained by the early 1900s, and its biodiversity was lost, but efforts to restore part of the wetland habitat began in 1996.

Mainly residential, it has some light industries (automobile electronics, textiles, pharmaceuticals), and there are some adjoining farms producing tomatoes, soybeans, and wheat. Greenfield is mainly known, however, as the birthplace of the Hoosier dialect poet James Whitcomb Riley (1849–1916), and the Riley Home (1850) on Main Street is preserved as a memorial and museum.

It was founded in 1869 when George Hammond, a pioneer in the shipping of refrigerated beef, established with Marcus Towle the State Line Slaughterhouse. Ice from the river and inland lakes was used for packing the meat. Until it was destroyed by fire in 1901, the packinghouse was the city’s largest industry. The city, first called Hohman and then State Line because of its location on the Illinois-Indiana border, was renamed in 1873 to honour the meatpacking magnate. Handicapped by the lack of a harbour, it failed to attract the heavy industry found in neighbouring cities but did develop diversified light manufacturing. Purdue University Calumet (1946) is there.

The original site (Forks of the Wabash) was a Miami village (home of the Miami chief Jean Baptiste Richardville and his successor, Francis La Fontaine), where many treaties with Native Americans were signed; it was known as Wepecheange (“Place of Flints”). The settlement that developed there was renamed in 1831 to honour Samuel Huntington, a member of the First Continental Congress. The city is now an agricultural trade centre with limestone quarrying in the vicinity. Its light manufactures include metal products, electronics, motor vehicle parts, and air-conditioning equipment. Huntington University (Church of the United Brethren in Christ, USA) was established in 1897. The Huntington County Historical Museum and a botanical garden and arboretum are in the city, as is the Dan Quayle Center (1993); Quayle, a former U.S. vice president, grew up in Huntington. Chief Richardville’s two-story frame house (1834) has been restored to its original appearance and is headquarters for Forks of the Wabash Historic Park, just west of the city.

The city is built on a level plain surrounded by low, gently sloping hills. It is a planned municipality, its layout resembling that of Washington, D.C., with radiating streets that converge on Monument Circle at the city centre. The climate is typical of the east-central Midwest, with warm to hot summers and cold winters; precipitation is moderate and spread fairly evenly throughout the year.[P1]Downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.Indiana TourismIndianapolis, Ind.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML1]Indianapolis, the largest city in the state, lies at the heart of a nine-county metropolitan area.

Indianapolis was founded in 1821 as the state capital, which it officially became in 1825. Some impetus for growth was given when the Cumberland (National) Road (modern Washington Street downtown) was routed across the city in 1827 and later when railroads arrived. Indianapolis had become a major rail centre by the start of the American Civil War in 1861, and its importance to Union logistics spurred further growth; its population more than doubled between 1860 and 1870.[P3]Groll, Theodor: Washington Street, Indianapolis, at DuskWashington Street, Indianapolis, at Dusk, oil on canvas by Theodor Groll, c. 1892–95; in the Indianapolis Museum of Art. 193 × 250 cm.Photograph by Jenny O'Donnell. Indianapolis Museum of Art, gift of a Couple of Old Hoosiers, 72.133[ML3] Beginning in the 1880s, meatpacking and metalworking emerged as major industries. The latter led to the development of automobile manufacturing as central to the city’s economy. The population of Indianapolis surpassed 100,000 in 1890 and continued to grow rapidly in the 20th century. The city was also a focus of labour organization in the late 19th century, and a number of influential trade unions—including the Carpenters and Joiners Union, the International Typographical Union, and the United Mine Workers of America—located their headquarters there.[P4] Indianapolis Motor Speedway opened in 1909 in suburban Speedway as a test track for local automobile plants. The first 500-mile (800-km) auto race, held there in 1911, was won by a locally made Marmon race car. Although automobile manufacturing eventually left the city, the Indianapolis 500 (held annually in late May on the weekend preceding Memorial Day) has become one of the world’s premier auto races, attracting enormous crowds.[P5] The city’s population approached a half million in 1960. In 1970 the governments of the city and Marion county were consolidated into a single entity. The city limits became coextensive with the limits of the county, thus increasing the city’s population by almost a half overnight and greatly expanding its tax base. The Marion county cities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, Speedway, and Southport remained autonomous under the arrangement, as did the county’s several school systems. People of European ancestry have long constituted the great majority of the population, but their proportion has diminished, and the number of African Americans has increased to more than one-fourth of the total.[P6] [H3]The contemporary city Indianapolis is one of the most populous cities in the world not located on navigable water, although it is a hub of road, rail, and air transportation. These facilities and the city’s position in the midst of the Corn Belt, near large coalfields and consumer markets, have combined to make it an important commercial, financial, and industrial centre. Pharmaceuticals and chemicals, machinery, plastics, wood and paper products, and transportation and electrical equipment (including televisions and audio equipment) are major products. It is also a regional distribution, retail, and health care centre, and tourism has grown in importance.[P7] A major educational and cultural centre, Indianapolis is the seat of Butler University (1855), Christian Theological Seminary (1925), Ivy Tech State College (1963), Lincoln Technical Institute (1946), Marian College (1851), Martin University (1977), and the University of Indianapolis (1902). Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (1969) includes Herron School of Art (1902) and an internationally renowned medical centre. The hub of the city, Monument Circle (1901), is the site of the 284.5-foot (87-metre) Indiana Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument. The Indiana War Memorial Plaza (1927) is a five-block area just to the north that honours the state’s war dead and includes the American Legion National Headquarters building. The State Capitol (1878–88), just west of the circle, is constructed of Indiana limestone and has a central rotunda 234 feet (71 metres) high. Hilbert Circle Theatre (1916), home of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, is adjacent to the circle, and Clowes Memorial Hall (1963), on the Butler campus, is a centre for the performing arts.[P8]Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.Indiana Tourism[ML8] The city has a convention-exposition centre (1972) and a museum of art (1883). The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis (1926) is the largest museum of its kind in the world and is one of the most frequently visited museums in the country. White River State Park, west of downtown, contains a number of attractions. The Indianapolis Zoo (1988) and the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art (1989) are located there, as are the main offices of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and its Hall of Champions Museum (2000). The Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum (1952), adjacent to the track, exhibits racing cars dating from 1909.[P9] Beginning in the 1970s, Indianapolis worked to make itself an international centre of amateur sports, an effort that produced considerable economic growth. In addition to the NCAA, the city attracted such organizations as the National Institute for Fitness and Sport, a centre of sports-physiology research. Other amateur venues include the Indianapolis Tennis Center (1979) and the Major Taylor Velodrome (1982), a bicycle-racing track. Lucas Oil Stadium (2008) is home to the Colts professional gridiron football team, and Bankers Life Fieldhouse (1999; formerly Conseco Fieldhouse) hosts the Pacers (men’s) and Fever (women’s) professional basketball teams.[P10] The Indiana State Fairgrounds, with more than 55 permanent buildings, including the Art Deco-style Pepsi Coliseum (1939), is a focus of trade and social activities. The annual state fair (August) attracts large crowds, as do the Indiana Black Expo Summer Celebration (July) and the Indy Jazz Fest (June). The Indianapolis homes of U.S. President Benjamin Harrison (1875) and poet James Whitcomb Riley (1872) have been preserved as museums. Other prominent city residents have included Charles Warren Fairbanks (vice president under Theodore Roosevelt), authors Booth Tarkington and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., and jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery.[P11] [END-OF-CONTENT]
Indiana"Jeffersonville"City"Clark county"southern Indiana"Jeffersonville, city, seat (1802–10; 1873) of Clark county, southern Indiana, U.S. It lies along the Ohio River (there bridged) at the head of the Falls of the Ohio, opposite Louisville, Kentucky. Built on land occupied by old Fort Steuben, it was laid out in 1802 on a plan suggested by President Thomas Jefferson, for whom it was named. The city prospered in the 19th century as a steamboat (river packet) building centre, turning out many paddle wheelers, including the renowned Natchez and J.M. White, but in 1937 it was inundated by river floodwaters. Located in an industrial and agricultural (grain, strawberries, tobacco) area, Jeffersonville is a barge terminal for river transportation and has shipyards. Fifty years after the last of the packet boats was built, the city produced the largest river steamboat made to that time, the 382-foot (116-metre) Mississippi Queen, commissioned in 1976 for luxury overnight cruises.

Indiana"Kokomo"City"Howard county"north-central Indiana"Kokomo, city, seat (1844) of Howard county, north-central Indiana, U.S., on Wildcat Creek, 52 miles (84 km) north of Indianapolis. In 1844 David Foster, a trader, laid out the village of Kokomo (named for a Miami chieftain) on part of the reservation once held by Chief La Fontaine. The settlement’s early growth was hampered by malarial swamps in the area, which were soon drained. The Peru and Indianapolis Railroad arrived in 1853, further stimulating the community’s growth. The modern city dates from 1886, when natural gas was discovered along the creek. The subsequent 10-year boom, which attracted many industries, collapsed when the gas ran out. The city was revived economically through pioneer work in the design and manufacture of the “horseless carriage” by two local men, Elwood Haynes and Elmer Apperson. A monument east of the city marks the place where one of the first clutch-driven automobiles with electric ignition in the United States was given its initial road test on July 4, 1894. Metallurgical experiments by Haynes paved the way for other industries, including the manufacture of stainless steel and a durable cobalt-chromium-tungsten alloy known as Stellite. By the mid-1920s competitors’ mass-production techniques had forced Haynes and Apperson to close their factories. Local citizens laboured to bring in new concerns, and, by the beginning of World War II, Kokomo was again an important manufacturing centre (electronics, machinery, automobile parts, aluminum die castings). It is the seat of Indiana University Kokomo (1945). The Howard County Museum, with historical exhibits about the Kokomo area, is located in the 1890 Seiberling Mansion, which also housed the university. The city’s Highland Park contains a covered bridge built in 1875. The Elwood Haynes Museum, in the inventor’s former home, exhibits many of his designs.

Laid out by William Digby on May 24, 1825, it was named for the American Revolutionary War hero the marquis de Lafayette, who was then making his last visit to the United States. The settlement soon became an important shipping centre on the Wabash, with the first steamboats arriving in 1826. The Wabash and Erie Canal reached Lafayette in 1843, further contributing to the community’s growth as a river entrepôt. It is about 5 miles (8 km) northeast of the first fortified white settlement in Indiana, Fort Ouiatenon, built by the French in 1717 to exploit fur trade with Native Americans. Lost to the English in 1761 and then to Pontiac’s confederation during the uprising of 1763, the fort was not regarrisoned after it reverted to British control two years later. It remained a small trading post and Native American village, and at times it was a centre of Native American agitation before being destroyed by General Charles Scott in 1791. The fort has been restored as a memorial-museum. The Battle of Tippecanoe (November 7, 1811), for which the county was named, was fought several miles north of the city; the battleground site is now a state memorial and national historical landmark. Lafayette is well industrialized (manufactures include aluminum, industrial, electrical, and rubber products, motor vehicles, and pharmaceuticals) and has a busy grain market. West Lafayette, across the river, is the seat of Purdue University (1869), a state institution and land-grant college named for a local businessman, John Purdue, whose gift secured its establishment there.

Indiana"Mishawaka"City"Joseph county"northern Indiana"Mishawaka, city, St. Joseph county, northern Indiana, U.S. It lies along the St. Joseph River, just east of South Bend. The community was founded around the St. Joseph Iron Works, built in 1833 to exploit nearby bog iron deposits, and two years later a village was platted under the company name; in 1838 it was combined with three adjacent plats as Mishawaka. The name is said to derive from the Potawatomi word for “country of dead trees.” Several thousand Belgian immigrants after World War I formed a substantial Flemish-speaking community in the city. Mishawaka is an industrial centre with manufactures including military and civilian vehicles, plastics, medical instruments, electric motors, and hydraulic equipment. Bethel College (1947) is operated by the Missionary Church. There are recreation facilities on the St. Joseph River and nearby lakes. Inc. 1899. Pop.

Indiana"Muncie"City"Delaware county"eastern Indiana"Muncie, city, seat of Delaware county, eastern Indiana, U.S. It lies along the White River, 55 miles (89 km) northeast of Indianapolis. Muncie is the average American town described in the classic sociological study Middletown, published in 1929 by Robert S. and Helen M. Lynd. The name (shortened in 1845 from Munseetown or Munsey Town) commemorates the Munsee (Wolf) clan of Delaware Indians who once lived there. The town was founded in 1827 when Goldsmith C. Gilbert, a trader, donated land for the county seat. The first railroad (1852) and the discovery of natural gas (first exploited 1886) contributed to the city’s growth. Although gas production failed in the early 1900s, the city continued to grow as a manufacturing and agricultural centre and a regional transportation hub. It is now a trading and industrial centre; diverse manufactures include automotive transmissions and parts, tools and dies, wire, paper, and plastics. Muncie is the seat of Ball State University (1918). Oakhurst Gardens, Minnetrista (which features artistic, historical, and horticultural exhibits), and the Academy of Model Aeronautics (a museum and competition site) are in the city. Summit Lake State Park is about 10 miles (15 km) south. The Lynd studies (Middletown in Transition appeared in 1937) were at first resented; since that time, however, Muncie has come to be proud of its “typical American” title.

Tennessee"Nashville"City""Nashville lies on the Cumberland River in the north-central part of the state"Nashville, also called Nashville-Davidson, city, capital (1843) of Tennessee, U.S., and seat (1784–1963) of Davidson county. Nashville lies on the Cumberland River in the north-central part of the state. It is the centre of an urbanized area that also embraces parts of seven surrounding counties. In 1963 the governments of the city of Nashville and of Davidson county were consolidated; the government now comprises a general services district, covering the entire county, and an urban services district, which encompasses the city of Nashville. Area city, 497 square miles (1,287 square km); Davidson county, 526 square miles (1,362 square km). Pop.

French fur traders established a post known as French Lick on the site in 1717. A force behind the area’s settlement was Richard Henderson, a North Carolina jurist who in 1775 acquired most of middle Tennessee and Kentucky in the Transylvania Purchase from the Cherokee. In 1779 he sent a party under James Robertson to investigate the Cumberland Valley. They settled at French Lick and were joined in the spring of 1780 by another group under John Donelson. Fort Nashborough, built at the site and named for American Revolutionary War general Francis Nash, became the centre of the new community. (A replica of the fort stands in a park along the Cumberland River.) Henderson is also credited with having written the Cumberland Compact, the articles of self-government adopted by the settlers. The community was renamed Nashville in 1784.[P2] Chartered as a city in 1806, Nashville developed as a river trade depot and manufacturing site for middle Tennessee and became the political centre of the state. Its commercial importance was further enhanced by the advent of the railroads in the 1850s. Nashville was occupied by Union troops in February 1862, and the last major American Civil War battle (December 15–16, 1864) took place outside the city, when Union forces under Gen. George H. Thomas defeated the Confederates under Gen. John B. Hood.[P3]Fortified Union railroad bridge across Cumberland River, Nashville, Tenn., 1864. Photograph by George N.

Barnard, 1864.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. (LC B8171-2629 LC)[ML3] Nashville’s recovery after the war was spurred by its central location in the region’s rail and water transport networks, although it experienced serious cholera epidemics in 1866 and 1873. The city became known for the many institutions of higher education that were founded there and was given the nickname “Athens of the South.” Nashville’s economy and population grew rapidly in the first decades of the 20th century, and it was also during that time that the city emerged as the centre of American traditional and country music. Regular radio broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry, a program of such music, began in Nashville in 1925 and continue today. Nashville’s industrial development accelerated in the 1930s after cheap electric power became available from the Tennessee Valley Authority and from dams on the Cumberland River. However, when it flooded after a two-day downpour in May 2010, the Cumberland brought damage to large parts of the city and took a number of lives.[P4] [H3]The contemporary city The modern economy is diversified. The music and entertainment industry is a primary factor, and services such as health care, finance and insurance, and education are major contributors. Manufacturing (including automobiles, automobile glass, trucks, tires, water heaters, aircraft parts, and appliances), printing and publishing (especially music and religious materials), and tourism are also important. The city’s central location, combined with an international airport, port facilities on the Cumberland, and rail and highway connections, make it a distribution and transportation centre. Agriculture in the region includes tobacco, livestock, dairy products, corn, and soybeans.[P5]Skyline and Cumberland River at dusk, Nashville.Jerry Driendl—Taxi/Getty Images[ML5] Nashville is known worldwide for country music, which is the basis of a large recording industry in the city. Much of that activity is clustered in an area of downtown called Music Row. The city has dozens of tourist attractions related to music, including the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the Ryman Auditorium, a concert venue that was once the home of the Opry. Grand Ole Opry radio shows can be seen in person at the Opry House, which is part of a complex including a hotel and shopping venues located east of downtown. At the International Country Music Fan Fair, held annually in June, fans can hear, meet, and get autographs from their favourite musicians.[P6]Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, Nashville, Tenn.© f11photo/Shutterstock,com[ML6] Nashville remains an educational as well as a religious centre, and several companies and denominations have publishing headquarters there, including the United Methodist Publishing House, one of the largest of its kind in the world. The city is the national headquarters of several boards and agencies of the United Methodist Church and the Sunday School Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. It is also the international headquarters of the Disciples of Christ Historical Society. Educational institutions affiliated with churches include Fisk University (1866; United Church of Christ), Belmont University (1890; Tennessee Southern Baptist Convention), Lipscomb University (1891; Churches of Christ), Trevecca Nazarene University (1901), and Aquinas College (1961; Roman Catholic). Nashville is also the seat of Vanderbilt University (1873), Meharry Medical College (1876), Tennessee State University (1912), and Nashville State Technical Institute (1970).[P7]Vanderbilt University: E.

Indiana"New Albany"City"Floyd county"southeastern Indiana"New Albany, city, seat (1819) of Floyd county, southeastern Indiana, U.S. It lies along the Ohio River (bridged) opposite Louisville, Kentucky. It was founded in 1813 by Joel, Abner, and Nathaniel Scribner, who named the settlement for Albany, New York. By the 1840s and early ’50s, New Albany had become the largest city in Indiana and, because of its location just below the Falls of the Ohio and near abundant forests, an important steamboat-building centre (the famous riverboats Robert E. Lee and Eclipse were built there). The modern city’s diversified manufactures include plastics, machinery, metal products, plywood, veneer, electronic equipment, fertilizer, and textiles. Indiana University Southeast (1941) is in the city. The boyhood home (built c. 1830) in New Albany of poet-dramatist William Vaughn Moody is preserved, as are the Scribner House (1814) and the Culbertson Mansion (1867–69), the former home (now a state historic site) of William S.

In 1900 a decade of expansion began when automobile and piano manufacturing, as well as other industries, were started there. During this same period, the large-scale commercial growing of roses was developed. New Castle’s diversified manufactures now include automobile parts and steel products. The city is the site of the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame and a branch of Indiana University East. Summit Lake State Park is 10 miles (16 km) northeast of the city.

Indiana"New Harmony"Town"Posey county"southwestern Indiana"New Harmony, town, Posey county, southwestern Indiana, U.S. It is located on the Wabash River at the Illinois border, 28 miles (45 km) northwest of Evansville. The site was first occupied by prehistoric mound builders and later was a camping ground for Piankashaw and other Indians. The settlement of Harmonie was founded in 1814–15 by George Rapp, a German Pietist preacher who had first gone to Pennsylvania in 1803 with his followers from Württemberg, Germany. When they later moved west, a prosperous Indiana colony evolved, but unrest brought on by hostile neighbours spurred the Rappite leaders to sell their holdings in 1825 to Robert Owen, who renamed the town New Harmony. Owen was a Welsh reformer who first went to the United States to found a cooperative community based on plans for humanity’s salvation through “rational” thinking, cooperation, and free education. He was aided by William Maclure, a Scottish-born geologist, businessman, and philanthropist who was a proponent of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi’s pedagogical methods and sought to establish them at the community. Maclure agreed to finance the schools, recruiting several dozen distinguished scholars and educators (the so-called “boatload of knowledge”) and providing scientific equipment and a library.[P1]Meier, Richard: AtheneumThe Atheneum, designed by Richard Meier, in New Harmony, Ind.Michael Gaebler[ML1]About 1,000 settlers responded to Owen’s public appeal, but most were misfits who ate his rations, argued over government, and were unable to perform the menial tasks vital to such a community. Farms and workshops lay idle while virtual anarchy reigned. By May 1827 Owen’s cash had been absorbed by payments for land and supplies, and he returned to Britain in 1828. The property was divided among five of Owen’s eight children, who, with some of the scientists and teachers, stayed on to develop one of the most notable pre-Civil War cultural centres in the United States. A laboratory, converted in 1843 from a Rappite granary by David Dale Owen (first U.S. and Indiana state geologist), was headquarters for what later became the U.S. Geological Survey. The 1818 structure was restored in the late 1990s, and another of Owen’s laboratories has also been restored.[P2]New Harmony is now an agricultural-trading centre and tourist destination. The town was made a national historic district in 1965, and many of the Harmonist and Rappite buildings have been restored, including the Robert Henry Fauntleroy House (1822–40), the Rapp-Maclure-Owen House (1844), Barrett Gate House (1815), Dormitory Number 2 (1822), and the Labyrinth (shrubbery; restored 1940) with its baffling pathways. The Roofless Church (1960), designed by architect Philip Johnson, has a Jacques Lipchitz sculpture. The ashes of theologian Paul Tillich are interred in Tillich Park. The Workingmen’s Institute (1894) was one of the country’s first free public libraries. Harmonie State Park is just south of the town. Inc. 1850. Pop. (2000) 916; (2010) 789.[P3] [END-OF-CONTENT]

Settled in 1806 by migrating North Carolina Quakers, it was first called Smithville and in 1818 amalgamated with neighbouring Coxborough (or Jericho) and incorporated as Richmond, a name supposedly indicative of the richness of local soil. The town’s growth was spurred by its location on the Cumberland (or National) Road, which reached Richmond in about 1835. Richmond has remained a centre of Quaker influence and organizations. The publications and general offices of the Friends United Meeting (Quakers) are located there, and group sessions are held regularly. The city is the seat of Earlham College (1847; Quaker-controlled) and Indiana University East (1971). An early manufacturing centre in a fertile area, Richmond is still important in agricultural marketing and processing. Industries include the manufacture of machinery, automobile parts, and fabricated metals. An annual rose festival held in June reflects the city’s large greenhouse rose-growing industry.

René-Robert Cavelier, sieur de La Salle, the French explorer, visited the locality in 1679, and under the old Council Oak Tree he parleyed in 1681 with the chiefs of the Miami and Illinois confederation. In 1820 Pierre Freischütz Navarre, an agent of the American Fur Company, established a trading post at the site (his cabin has been restored). Three years later the post was bought by Alexis Coquillard and his business partner, Francis Comparet; Coquillard named the place Big St. Joseph Station and promoted European settlement. In 1828 the Michigan Road, the state’s first north-south highway, was laid down nearby, and the next year the settlement became known as Southold. The community was subsequently renamed (1830) for the great bend in the St. Joseph River.[P1]South Bend: Studebaker National MuseumStudebaker National Museum, South Bend, Ind.Derek Jensen[ML1]Former (pioneer) industries of South Bend were the Studebaker Brothers Manufacturing Company (1852, later an auto plant), the Oliver Chilled Plow Works (1855), and the Singer Sewing Machine Company cabinet works (1868). Despite the eventual closure of these companies, South Bend’s economy has remained highly industrialized. The metropolitan area has been dubbed Michiana because it also serves as the trade and financial focus of southern Michigan as well as northern Indiana.[P2]The University of Notre Dame (1842) is situated just outside South Bend. It has become a significant additional economic asset with its “Fighting Irish” gridiron football team, Notre Dame Stadium, Snite Museum of Art, Hesburgh Memorial Library (one of the world’s largest college libraries), Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, and Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center. Also near South Bend are St. Mary’s College (1844), Indiana University South Bend (1933), and Holy Cross (junior) College (1966).

Indiana"Terre Haute"City"Vigo county"western Indiana"Terre Haute, city, seat (1818) of Vigo county, western Indiana, U.S. It lies on a 10-mile (16-km) square plateau above the Wabash River (whence its French name meaning “high ground”), 71 miles (114 km) west-southwest of Indianapolis. The site was once a place of rendezvous for Indian tribes, and nearby Fort Harrison, built in 1811, was frequently attacked by Tecumseh’s Shawnee. Laid out in 1816, it became an important community on the Cumberland (National) Road (1835), the Wabash and Erie Canal (1849), and the Terre Haute and Richmond Railroad (1852). Development of local bituminous coal deposits in the 1860s plus several oil wells stimulated industrial growth. Miners organized early, and the city is remembered in labour history for militant union activity. The 1890 home of Eugene V. Debs, who organized the country’s first industrial union (American Railway Union) in Terre Haute in 1893, still stands as a memorial and labour museum. The city subsequently acquired highly diversified industries including the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, packaging products, trailers, and audiocassettes and compact discs. A federal penitentiary was built south of the city in the 1940s. Terre Haute is the seat of Indiana State University (1865) and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (1874). St. Mary-of-the-Woods College (1840) is about 5 miles (8 km) north. Author Theodore Dreiser (An American Tragedy) and his brother, the composer Paul Dresser (“On the Banks of the Wabash”), were born in Terre Haute; the latter’s birthplace is preserved as a state shrine and memorial, and a pair of bridges over the Wabash are named for the brothers.

Indiana’s oldest city, Vincennes figured prominently in early American history from the time of its settlement (1702, or possibly earlier) by French traders on the site of an Indian village. A fort, one of a chain from Quebec to New Orleans, was erected by the French in 1732, and in 1736 the settlement around it was named for François-Marie Bissot, sieur de Vincennes, its commanding officer. Ceded to the British at the end of the French and Indian War (1763), the settlement was virtually self-governing until the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War and remained predominantly French in population and tradition for almost 100 years after that. A British force occupied the fort (renaming it Fort Sackville) for a brief period, but briefly in 1778 and finally in 1779 it was taken by American forces under George Rogers Clark. Clark’s victory at Vincennes, followed by the passage of the Northwest Ordinance (1787), brought an influx of settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. From 1800 to 1813 Vincennes was the capital of Indiana Territory (commemorated by a state historic site). The Indiana Gazette, the first territorial newspaper, was published there in 1804 by Elihu Stout. At Vincennes, Governor (later President) William Henry Harrison negotiated several treaties with the Native Americans and launched the campaign that culminated in the Battle of Tippecanoe (November 1811). George Rogers Clark National Historical Park (1936, on the former site of the fort), Grouseland (1802–04; the Harrison mansion), and Vincennes University, a junior college founded in 1806, are among the many historic sites in the city. The Basilica of St. Francis Xavier (Old Cathedral), begun in 1826, is still in use. Fort Knox II, from which Harrison and his troops began the military excursion that ended at the Battle of Tippecanoe, is 3 miles (5 km) north of the city.[P1]Vincennes, Ind.: George Rogers Clark MemorialGeorge Rogers Clark Memorial, Vincennes, Ind.Indiana Tourism[ML1]The city is a commercial centre for an agricultural region (grains, soybeans, melons) and has some light industries, including the manufacture of wire, wood and paper products, and glass.

 Iowa"Amana Colonies"City""west-northwest of Iowa City"Amana Colonies, settlement in Iowa county, east-central Iowa, U.S. It lies near the Iowa River, 20 miles (32 km) west-northwest of Iowa City, and comprises a group of seven small villages: Amana, East Amana, Middle Amana, High Amana, West Amana, South Amana, and Homestead.[P1]Amana developed from the Community of True Inspiration, founded in 1714 in the German principality of Hesse by the pietistic mystics Johann Friedrich Rock and Eberhard Ludwig Gruber. The community disintegrated after Rock’s death in 1749, but it was revived in 1817 by Christian Metz and Barbara Heinemann and became centred mainly in Württemberg. The sect encountered hostility from the civil authorities because of its members’ opposition to war, and in 1842 they emigrated to the United States, purchasing land near Buffalo, New York, where they established the communal Ebenezer Society. In 1855 about 1,200 members moved westward to Iowa, where 18,000 acres (7,300 hectares), later expanded to 26,000 acres (10,500 hectares), had been purchased. This new home was called Amana (after a mountain range in Lebanon referred to in Song of Solomon 4:8 and meaning “to remain true” or “to believe faithfully”) and was incorporated in 1859. Members gave up their property to a common fund and in return were promised economic security through life. In addition to communal property and opposition to military service, the citizens of Amana opposed taking oaths, amusement, and a paid ministry.[P2]The community prospered at first but began to decline after the American Civil War. Financial disaster caused by the Great Depression necessitated “The Great Change,” the reorganization of the community in 1932. Members voted to separate religious and economic interests, and the community became more open to the outside world. Communal property was dissolved, and the villages were organized on the basis of a joint-stock corporation, called the Amana Society, with the workers as stockholders. In addition to its farms, the Amana Society operates factories that produce woolens, furniture, wines, bakery goods, and meat specialties. Amana Refrigeration, Inc., formerly a division of the Amana Society, manufactures refrigerators, freezers, and microwave ovens. The Amana Church Society, separately organized in 1932, continues its pietistic traditions, emphasizes Bible study and prayer, and remains the dominant force in the community. Simple worship services are conducted in German in unadorned village churches. The Amana Church Society, which is governed by elected elders and has no ordained clergy, had more than 500 members in four churches in the early 21st century. The Amana Colonies, designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1965, are a major tourist attraction that welcomes more than 1.5 million visitors each year. Pop.

When the state capital was moved there from Iowa City later that year, its continued growth was assured. The origin of the city’s place-name is controversial: it is possibly a French corruption of the Algonquian name for the river, Moingona; alternatively, it may be derived from the French de moyen (“middle”), being midway between the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, or perhaps it was a reference to the Trappist monks (moines de la Trappe) who once lived at the mouth of the Des Moines River.[P2]From 1910 to 1920 Des Moines expanded rapidly as local coal deposits were developed.

Kansas"Dodge City"City"Ford county"southwestern Kansas"Dodge City, city, seat (1873) of Ford county, southwestern Kansas, U.S., on the Arkansas River. Fort Dodge, 5 miles (8 km) east, was established in 1864 and named for Colonel Henry I. Dodge. Settled in 1872 with the arrival of the Santa Fe Railway, Dodge City attained notoriety as a frontier town on the Santa Fe Trail, the rendezvous of picturesque characters, the centre of freight lines, and the headquarters of the cattle business. At the peak of the cattle drives, in 1884, herds totaling 8,000,000 head passed through from Texas. Lawlessness and gunfights resulted in the establishment of Boot Hill Cemetery, and a succession of marshals and sheriffs, including Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp, won fame in the annals of the West. The famous Front Street has been restored and is now a popular tourist attraction that generates much of the city’s revenue. Beeson Museum exhibits many pioneer relics. The modern city has railroad shops, cattle feed yards, and farm-implement plants and is the supply centre for a wheat, sorghum, and stock-raising area. The “Home of Stone,” built in 1881 with 2.5-foot- (.75-metre-) thick limestone walls, contains furniture and memorabilia from the city’s early period.

Kansas"Emporia"City"Lyon county"east-central Kansas"Emporia, city, seat (1860) of Lyon county, east-central Kansas, U.S. It lies between the Cottonwood and Neosho rivers. Established in 1857 by a town company whose charter prohibited the sale and consumption of alcohol within the town site, it was named after a legendary ancient city in North Africa or for a market centre in Greece. The settlement developed as a trading centre after the arrival of the railroad (Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe) in 1869. Severe droughts that plagued the city were ended in 1938 with the damming of the Kahola valley 25 miles (40 km) to the northwest. The Emporia Gazette became probably the best-known and respected “small-town” newspaper in the United States under the editorship of William Allen White, who bought it in 1895. The William Allen White House is a state historic site. The city is now the trading and shipping centre of a large farming and dairying area and is the seat of Emporia State University (1863) and Flint Hills Technical College (1963).

 Kansas"Kansas City"City"Wyandotte county"northeastern Kansas"Kansas City, city, seat (1866) of Wyandotte county, northeastern Kansas, U.S. It lies at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers and is contiguous with Kansas City, Missouri. When the Lewis and Clark expedition arrived at the river junction in 1806, it was the site of several Osage and Kansa Indian camps; in his journal William Clark described the spot as a desirable location for a fort or trading post.[P1]Present-day Kansas City was formed by the consolidation of eight separate towns. The earliest, Wyandotte, was bought from an Indian tribe, laid out in 1857 by a town company, and incorporated in 1859. The founding of rival settlements by proslavery and abolitionist supporters after passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854) brought rapid development. The Kansas constitution, under which the territory entered the Union in 1861, was written in Wyandotte. In 1863 Wyandotte became the eastern terminus of the Union Pacific, Eastern Division (from 1868 to 1880 known as the Kansas Pacific), which was a portion of the first transcontinental railroad. Vast herds of Texas cattle were driven to Kansas Pacific railheads, and Wyandotte became a major marketing and reshipment point, and by the 1870s stockyards and meatpacking plants had sprung up. Old Kansas City and Riverview (which became part of Wyandotte in 1880) developed during the 1870s. The settlement of Armstrong grew on a hill south of Wyandotte. North of the Kansas River an industrial district, Armourdale, named for a meatpacking plant, was laid out in 1880. South of the Kansas, Argentine grew up around the Santa Fe Railway shops and rail yards and became the site of a smelter. These, except for Argentine (annexed in 1910), combined as a first-class city on March 6, 1886, taking the name Kansas City. Rosedale, also south of the river and the seat of the University of Kansas Medical Center, was annexed in 1922. Absorbed earlier was Quindaro, which had been founded by antislavery leaders as a free port on the Missouri. The entire metropolitan area is subject to episodic flooding; during the 20th century, floods in 1903, 1951, 1977, and 1993 inflicted severe damage on the city.[P2]Much of the heavy industry of the Kansas City metropolitan area is within the city. Manufactures include chemicals, paper goods, automobiles, railroad cars, petroleum and soap products, fabricated steel, and dairy and agricultural commodities. In addition to the medical centre, Kansas City is the seat of Donnelly (junior) College (1949), Kansas City Kansas Community College (1923), Central Baptist Theological Seminary, and the Kansas State School for the Visually Handicapped.

It was founded in 1854 by antislavery radicals who had come to Kansas under the auspices of the New England Emigrant Aid Company to outvote proslavery settlers and thus make Kansas a “free” state. The city was named for Amos A. Lawrence, a New England textile manufacturer who funded the company’s settlement efforts. It was a noted station on the Underground Railroad by which slaves escaped into free territory. As a Jayhawker (abolitionist) headquarters, the town was sacked in 1856 by a proslavery militia under David Rice Atchison, a former Democratic senator from Missouri, and in 1863 by Confederate guerrillas under the command of William Clarke Quantrill, who massacred more than 150 citizens and burned much of the city.[P1]Lawrence: University of KansasLippincott Hall, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas.InaMaka[ML1]Lawrence has some small factories, but it is essentially a college town.

The site was regarded as sacred by the Kiowa Indians, who erected huts on the banks of the river, which is rich in magnesium sulfate, or Epsom salts; white settlers called these huts “medicine lodges.” In 1867 representatives of the Five Tribes of the Plains—the Kiowa, Cheyenne, Comanche, Arapaho, and Kiowa Apache—met there with U.S. commissioners to negotiate a treaty that opened the area to white settlement and railroads and fixed the southern boundary of Kansas. The town was laid out in 1873 and was incorporated as a city in 1879.[P1]The city is now a shipping point for wheat and cattle and is the site of a large gypsum plant based on the nearby Gypsum Hills, a scenic area of canyons, towering mesas, and buttes.

Read More on This Topic Kansas …the capital was located in Topeka by popular election, outpolling nearby Lawrence by some 2,700 votes. The state’s name is derived from that of the Kansa, or Kaw, whose name comes from a Siouan-language phrase meaning “people of the south wind.” READ MORE The name Topeka is of uncertain Indian origin; one interpretation is “smoky hill,” and another is “a good place to dig potatoes.” The present site was chosen in 1854 by a group of antislavery colonists from Lawrence, led by Charles Robinson, a resident agent of the New England Emigrant Aid Company. Cyrus K. Holliday helped to found the city, which later became headquarters for the building of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway system, of which he was the first president. Before the American Civil War, Topeka was the scene of several conflicts between the Free Soil groups (which opposed the extension of slavery into the West) and slave interests in Kansas Territory, of which it was the temporary capital (1856). Topeka also was the centre of a major battle in the civil rights era in 1954, when plaintiffs successfully challenged segregation in the city’s public schools in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka; the Monroe Elementary School, one of the segregated schools, and its grounds were designated a national historic site by the U.S. Congress in 1992. A tornado destroyed much of Topeka in 1966; annihilating some 800 homes and damaging 3,000 others, it was the costliest tornado in U.S. history to that time.[P2]Topeka’s economy is based on agriculture, manufacturing, and governmental services. From 1925 to 2003 Topeka was the home of the Menninger Foundation, an outstanding psychiatric-training institution. The city is the seat of Washburn University (1865); Mulvane Art Museum is located on Washburn’s campus.

Area 82,278 square miles (213,100… READ MORE History Wichita was founded in 1864 as a trading post on the site of a village of the Wichita Indians. It owed its early development to the Texas cattle trade along the Chisholm Trail and to the rapid spread of agricultural settlement along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, then under construction. In its early years Wichita was a stopover on cattle drives to Abilene (Kansas) and other points as the railroad moved west; in 1872 the line reached Wichita, and the city became a major cattle-shipping centre. By 1875 farmers’ fences were obstructing the movement of beef herds, but grain became an important commodity.[P3] Growth was continuous and rapid after 1900, with the population surpassing 100,000 in the 1920s and 250,000 in the 1950s. Meatpacking was a major industrial activity at the beginning of the 20th century, but aircraft manufacturing, begun in the 1920s, soon dominated Wichita’s economy. The discovery of oil there added to the city’s wealth. People of European ancestry have for long constituted the great majority of the population. African Americans, roughly one-tenth of the total, constitute the largest minority group, and there are small but growing communities of Hispanics and Asians.[P4] [H3]The contemporary city Wichita’s economy has become much more diversified since the heyday of aviation manufacturing. Aircraft and aerospace industries continue to be leading economic activities, although they remain susceptible to market fluctuations (such as the downturn in the airline industry following the September 11 attacks in 2001). Other manufactures include machinery, computer and precision equipment, and chemicals and petrochemicals. Services (including wholesale and retail trade, government, and health care) are increasingly important, as is the economic input of McConnell Air Force Base, which adjoins the city on the southeast.[P5] Wichita is the seat of Friends University (1898), Newman University (1933), and Wichita State University (1895). The city has a symphony orchestra and a ballet company. The Museum of World Treasures houses an extensive collection of ancient arts; the Wichita Art Museum contains works by American artists; and the Mid-America All-Indian Center traces the culture and history of Native American peoples.[P6] Other popular attractions include the Sedgwick County Zoo; Botanica, the Wichita Gardens, which has several theme-based gardens; and Old Cowtown Museum, a 17-acre (7-hectare) living-history museum that contains restored buildings and re-creates Wichita life of the 1865–80 period. Wichita is home to the National Baseball Congress, the governing body for adult nonprofessional baseball in the United States, and Mid-Continent Airport, in the southwestern part of the city, is the headquarters of the International Flying Farmers, a pilots’ association. The annual Wichita River Festival, held in May, is a popular multiple-day event.

The group, under a grant from the Cherokees (regarded as illegal by Britain and Virginia), claimed all the land between the Kentucky and Cumberland rivers, which they called Transylvania. The Transylvania Convention held at the fort in May 1775 was the first legislative assembly west of the Appalachian Mountains. During the American Revolution, the settlement was under constant Indian attack.

In 1817 it had presented the first Beethoven symphony heard in the United States.[P1]The Red Mile racecourse at Lexington, Ky.Tony Leonard/Shostal Associates[ML1]Horse racing on the town common was prohibited in 1788, and the racecourse was rebuilt in another part of town. Devotion to fine racing horses remains a local passion, with flat racing at Keeneland and trotting at the “Red Mile.” The American Thoroughbred Breeders Association has its headquarters in Lexington. Surrounded by rich farmlands, the city is an important market for beef cattle, sheep, spring lambs, bluegrass seed, and loose-leaf tobacco. Its manufactures include bourbon whiskey, printed products, construction and mining equipment, computer software, and telecommunications and electronic equipment. The University of Kentucky and Lexington Theological Seminary were founded there in 1865; there are also two business colleges, and Lexington is headquarters for the Kentucky Community and Technical College System, established in 1997.[P2]John C. Breckinridge, vice president of the United States in 1857–61, as well as the Confederate general John Hunt Morgan, members of the Todd family, and U.S. Senator Henry Clay, are buried in Lexington Cemetery. The homes of Clay, Morgan, and Mary Todd Lincoln are public shrines. The Headley-Whitney Museum on the Old Frankfurt Pike displays bibelots executed in precious jewels.

During the American Revolution, a group of settlers accompanying the American officer George Rogers Clark settled (May 1778) on Corn Island (since swept away by floods) opposite Beargrass Creek, where Clark organized a base for the conquest of the British-held Old Northwest. Most of the settlers who came with him moved ashore the following winter and established Fort-on-Shore (Fort Nelson) within the present city limits. The town was organized in 1779 and named for Louis XVI of France; it was incorporated as a town the following year.[P2]By 1811 Louisville had become an important frontier and river-flatboat trading place, and its development was further stimulated that year when Captain Nicholas Roosevelt docked the New Orleans, the first successful steamboat to ply the waters of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The city had become a major river port by 1820, and further stimulation came about with the construction (1825–30) of the canal around the 25-foot- (8-metre-) high Falls. Louisville’s commercial influence extended over a vast area of the South and the Midwest. During the American Civil War, the city served as a military headquarters and a major Union supply depot. It escaped the ravages of war and became an important way station for slaves seeking freedom in Indiana, across the river. A vigorous campaign to reclaim the South’s trade followed the war. In the 1880s the Louisville and Nashville Railroad was extended to Jacksonville, Florida.[P3]Early map of the falls of the Ohio River, site of Louisville, Ky.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.Plan of Louisville, Ky., 1836.

Periodic flooding of the Ohio necessitated extensive protection work; a destructive flood in 1937 caused widespread damage.[P4]New industries were established during World War II, notably the production of synthetic rubber. The city is a leading producer of bonded bourbon whiskey and cigarettes. In addition to synthetic rubber, other products include paint and varnish, aluminum items, appliances, automobiles, pottery, and printed matter. Services are increasingly important, notably health care administration, and Louisville International Airport is a national hub of air cargo traffic. Tourism is also an important component of the economy. The American Printing House for the Blind (1858), which publishes books in Braille, is located in Louisville, as is the headquarters of the Hillerich & Bradsby Company, makers of the famed Louisville Slugger baseball bats (although most bats are now made elsewhere).[P5]The University of Louisville was founded in 1798 as Jefferson Seminary. The city is also the seat of two Roman Catholic institutions—Spalding University (1814) and Bellarmine College (1950). Southern Baptist (1859) and Louisville Presbyterian (1853) theological seminaries are also in the city. The J.B.

The city’s inhabitants and the U.S.-born citizens of the surrounding parishes rebelled against Spanish rule on September 23, 1810, and established the West Florida Republic, which was annexed by the United States three months later. Baton Rouge was incorporated in 1817, and in 1849 it became capital of the state.[P2]On January 26, 1861, Louisiana joined the Confederacy, shortly before the start of the American Civil War. Union forces initially captured the city but withdrew following an indecisive battle there against Confederate forces on August 5, 1862.

Baton Rouge is the seat of Louisiana State University (1860) and Southern University (1880).[P4]The city’s growth as an industrial centre began with the building of a giant refinery by the Standard Oil Company in 1909. Subsequently, many industries were established there by the mid-1930s, attracted by the proximity of the oil fields (in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana), low-cost ocean and river transportation, and the abundance of natural gas and other natural resources. Dock facilities were expanded in the 1920s, and the Port Allen–Morgan City Cut-Off Canal was constructed. Under the impetus of petrochemical industries established there during and after World War II, the city’s population grew from about 35,000 to more than 125,000 in the 1940s, the annexation of surrounding suburbs contributing to this increase.

After the war the city became a supply centre for much of the booming oil and gas industry of southern Louisiana. Heymann Oil Center (1952), headquarters for many companies, has its own post office and shopping facilities. The city also remains a major distribution centre for cotton, sugar, lumber, and livestock.[P1]Lafayette: Cathedral of St. John the EvangelistCathedral of St. John the Evangelist, Lafayette, La.Mc361210[ML1]Before the oil boom Lafayette was primarily a Cajun town, and the older culture is evident in the prevalence of French and the local Cajun dialect. A growing population attracted to the local oil industry has created a more cosmopolitan community. Although many of the older customs have disappeared, the Live Oak Society works to preserve native southern live oak trees, and the Camellia Show and Mardi Gras are still celebrated. Nearby is Acadian Village, a restored community of authentic Acadian homes, museums, and other buildings dating from the early 1800s.

Initially a port for pirates, especially Jean Laffite, the site was first settled about 1781 and named for Charles Sallier, an early lakeside settler. In the 1880s it was promoted as a base for exploring the heavily timbered pinelands to the north and west.

Louisiana"New Orleans"City""southeastern Louisiana"New Orleans, city, southeastern Louisiana, U.S. Unquestionably one of the most distinctive cities of the New World, New Orleans was established at great cost in an environment of conflict. Its strategic position, commanding the mouth of the great Mississippi-Missouri river system, which drains the rich interior of North America, made it a pawn in the struggles of Europeans for the control of North America. As a result, the peoples of New Orleans evolved a unique culture and society, while at the same time blending many heritages. Its citizens of African descent provided a special contribution in making New Orleans the birthplace of jazz.[P1]New Orleans: St. Louis CathedralSt. Louis Cathedral, New Orleans.© MedioImages/Getty ImagesA discussion of the history and traditions of New Orleans, from the documentary New Orleans: A Living Museum of Music.Great Museums Television[ML1]New Orleans is a city of paradox and contrast: while it shares the urban problems afflicting other U.S. cities, it has nevertheless preserved an exuberant and uninhibited spirit, perhaps best exemplified by its Carnival season, which culminates in the famous annual Mardi Gras, when more than a million people throng the streets. The city also has a solid economic base: it is the largest city in Louisiana, one of the country’s most important ports, a major tourist resort, and a medical, industrial, and educational centre. It was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, when the levees protecting the city were breached and nearly all of the city was flooded. The storm and its aftermath killed hundreds, caused massive property damage, and forced a full-scale evacuation of the city.

The boundaries are formed by the Mississippi River and Jefferson parish to the west and Lake Pontchartrain to the north. Lake Pontchartrain is connected by The Rigolets channel to Lake Borgne on the east (and thence to the gulf), and the southern boundary of New Orleans is made up of St. Bernard parish and, again, the Mississippi River. The city is divided by the Mississippi, with the principal settlement on the east bank. The west bank, known as Algiers, has grown rapidly. It is connected to eastern New Orleans by the Greater New Orleans Bridge (also known as the Crescent City Connection). The bridge, completed in 1958, proved to be a bottleneck to the city’s traffic; a second, adjacent bridge designed to reduce congestion was completed in 1988.[P3] The early city was located on the east bank along a sharp bend in the Mississippi, from which the nickname “Crescent City” is derived. The modern metropolis has spread far beyond this original location. Because its saucer-shaped terrain lies as low as 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 metres) below sea level and has an average rainfall of 57 inches (1,448 mm), a levee, or embankment, system and proper drainage have always been of prime importance. There had long been concern that a powerful storm could inundate the low-lying city; such an event occurred in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina produced a storm surge that overwhelmed the levees protecting New Orleans, and about four-fifths of the city was flooded. Less than a month later, a second hurricane passing to the west caused some levees to fail again, flooding a few areas of the city once more.[P4]Aerial view of flooding in the New Orleans area following Hurricane Katrina, August 2005.Paul Morse/The White House[ML4] Climate New Orleans has a moderate climate; the average daily temperature from October through March is 60 °F (16 °C), and from April through September the daily average is 77 °F (25 °C). Freezing weather is rare, and the temperature rises above 95 °F (35 °C) only about six days per year.[P5] [H3]People The population of New Orleans has been declining. Whites account for less than one-third of the total, whereas in 1960 they made up almost two-thirds. In contrast to the population decline in Orleans parish, the adjacent parishes of St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. Charles, St. John the Baptist, and St. Tammany—which, together with Orleans, compose the New Orleans Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)—have shown steady increases. Since the African American population in most of the adjacent parishes is quite small, these figures indicate the general trend of white movement to the suburbs typical of most major U.S. cities since 1950.[P6] The shift in population to the suburbs has been motivated less by racial tension (although this may play a part) than by desires for better and more modern living facilities. The fact that a large segment of the black population resides in declining neighbourhoods (some segregated, some integrated) has spurred both black and interracial political, social, and religious organizations to work either independently or with city and federal agencies on projects to improve the quality of life for low-income citizens. The additional fact that New Orleans has upper-class and middle-class black populations has been a significant factor in such projects.[P7] Page 1 of 6 Next page Economy

Originally known as Poste des Attakapas (for a local Indian tribe), it was settled about 1760. A colony of Acadians, expelled by the British from Nova Scotia, arrived in 1765; this event laid ground for the story of Evangeline made famous in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s poem. Evangeline’s romance with Gabriel is perpetuated in the Longfellow-Evangeline State Commemorative Area just outside the town. St. Martin’s Church (1832) replaced an earlier structure (1765) that was the mother church of the Acadians; the grave of Emmeline Labiche, traditionally believed to have been Evangeline, is behind the church. After the French Revolution many Royalist refugees went to St. Martinville, which became a focus of French customs and culture and was known as Le Petit Paris (“Little Paris”). After Louisiana became a state in 1812, the town was named for St. Martin of Tours. The community thrived as a river resort for New Orleans society but struggled just before the American Civil War; yellow fever, a disastrous fire, a damaging hurricane, and the end of steamboat travel all contributed to its decline.[P1]Saint Martinville: St. Martin parish courthouseSt. Martin parish courthouse, Saint Martinville, Louisiana.Ken Lund[ML1]Sugar, rice, cotton, salt, timber, and oil are produced in St. Martinville today.

Maine"Brunswick"Town"Cumberland county"southwestern Maine"Brunswick, town, Cumberland county, southwestern Maine, U.S., at the falls of the Androscoggin River, 26 miles (42 km) northeast of Portland. First known as Pejepscot, the town originated in 1628 as a trading post, but Indian hostility retarded its early development. Growth began with its incorporation as a township in 1717, when it was named for the duchy of Brunswick, to which the king of England belonged. Control of municipal affairs by town meetings open to all registered voters continued until 1969, when a council-town manager government was adopted. The falls of the Androscoggin River furnished power for lumber and cotton milling and the manufacture of paper, textiles, and other products, but the closing of the last mill in 1955 ended the textile era. Manufactures now include shoes, composites, and candles. Bowdoin College was founded there in 1794; the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum on its campus displays memorabilia of explorers Robert E. Peary and Donald B. MacMillan, who are Bowdoin alumni. The Brunswick Naval Air Station, established during World War II, was reactivated in 1951. The town is the site of the Stowe House (1807), where Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852). Facilities for both summer and winter recreation are nearby. Inc. 1739.

Maine"Castine"Town"Hancock county"southern Maine"Castine, historic resort town, Hancock county, southern Maine, U.S., on a promontory in Penobscot Bay, across the water from Belfast (west). For 200 years the place held a key position in the struggle between England and France—and to a lesser extent the Netherlands—for control of the Acadian seaboard. In 1613 the French constructed a trading post (later Fort Pentagoet) at the site. A trading post for the Plymouth colony also was built there, in 1626, but was attacked by French buccaneers in 1632. French Capuchin and Jesuit missions were established in the vicinity in the 1640s. The Frenchman Jean-Vincent d’Abbadie, Baron St. Castin (for whom the town was named), lived there (1667–97); he married the daughter of a local (Tarratine) Indian chief and played a prominent role in conflicts with the British and Dutch. The site was permanently settled by English colonists in 1760. In 1779, during the American Revolution, a naval expedition, in which Paul Revere participated, unsuccessfully tried to take Castine from the British, who held it until 1783. The much-harassed settlement was finally incorporated in 1796, only to be again occupied by the British for nearly a year during the War of 1812.[P1]CastineChurch in Castine, Maine.Casey Theberge/NOAA[ML1]The town has more than 100 historic markers.

Settled about 1780, it once included the town of Lubec (which is south and slightly farther east than Eastport) and was known as Moose Island, but upon incorporation as a town (1798) it was renamed for being the nation’s most easterly port. It was captured by British troops during the War of 1812 and remained under martial law until 1818, when it was returned to the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Ghent. Eastport was the scene of considerable activity during the 1930s when the federal government began work on the Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project to harness the exceptionally high tides (up to 27 feet [8 metres]) of Passamaquoddy Bay for hydroelectric power. The project resulted in the construction of two tidal dams but was never completed.[P1]Eastport’s economy, once heavily dependent on sardine fishing and canning, has diversified. The city has become a major centre of the aquaculture industry; Atlantic salmon are farmed in offshore pens, and nori seaweed is cultivated. Eastport has a textile mill, and logs and paper products are shipped from the city’s deepwater port. Tourism is important. Old Sow, said to be one of the largest whirlpools in the world, is nearby.

In 1694 the colonial capital was moved there from St. Mary’s City. The next year it was renamed to honour Princess Anne, who later, as queen, gave it a charter (1708). Annapolis patriots, like those of Boston, had a “tea party,” on October 19, 1774, forcing the owner of the brig Peggy Stewart to burn his ship and cargo of taxed tea. George Washington resigned (December 23, 1783) as commander in chief of the Continental Army before the U.S. Congress in session there (November 26, 1783–June 3, 1784). The city avoided involvement in the battles of the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War, though many Civil War wounded were hospitalized there. The Annapolis Convention, held in 1786, was a precursor to the Constitutional Convention of 1787.[P2]A port city, Annapolis has boatyards in Eastport and is the home port for a large number of private sailing vessels and other pleasure boats.

READ MORE History Baltimore was established in 1729 and named for the Irish barony of Baltimore (seat of the Calvert family, proprietors of the colony of Maryland). It was created as a port for shipping tobacco and grain, and soon local waterways were being harnessed for flour milling. At the outbreak of the American Revolution, it was a bustling seaport and shipbuilding centre. Baltimore clippers plied the seas, and trade extended to the Caribbean. The U.S. Navy’s first ship, the Constellation, was launched in Baltimore in 1797, and its namesake, the last all-sail warship built (1854) for the navy, has been moored in the city’s harbour since 1955; in the late 1990s the ship underwent extensive restoration. The Continental Congress met in Baltimore (December 1776–March 1777) when it was feared that the British would attack Philadelphia, then the national capital.[P2] During the War of 1812 the British tried to capture Baltimore; U.S. forces’ successful defense (September 13–14, 1814) of nearby Fort McHenry (now a national monument and historic shrine) was the inspiration for Francis Scott Key’s poem “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The eastern terminus for the nation’s first railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio (1827), was the city’s Mount Clare Station; the station has been preserved and is now the site of a railroad museum. During the American Civil War (1861–65), though Maryland did not secede from the Union, many of its citizens had Southern sympathies. Union troops occupied Baltimore throughout the war, and the city recovered only gradually from that period of severe disruption.[P3]Fort McHenry, Inner Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.Baltimore Area Convention & Visitors Association; photo, Richard NowitzFort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine, Baltimore, Md.Tim Tadder/Maryland Office of TourismAmerican Civil War: MarylandDiscover how the socioeconomic and political divisions that contributed to the American Civil War played out in Maryland.© Civil War Trust[ML3] A fire on February 7, 1904, razed most of the business district, but recovery was rapid. At the beginning of World War I, Baltimore began to develop industrially with the construction of steelworks, oil refineries, and related war industries. In the 1920s and early ’30s Baltimore acquired an intellectual aura from the work of essayist and editor H.L. Mencken and his circle, including journalists on the Sun newspaper. A period of urban decay in the city centre after World War II was followed by a major renovation of the downtown and waterfront areas.[P4]Map of Baltimore, Md., c. 1900 from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML4] [H3]The contemporary city Baltimore is now a major seaport with ship-repair facilities and a highly diversified economy.

Massachusetts’s residents represent an amalgamation of the prototypical Yankee… READ MORE Character of the city The area, the people, and the institutions within its political boundaries can only begin to define the essence of Boston. Its nickname “Beantown” has its origin in colonial times, when Boston, as a stop on a major trade route with the West Indies, had a steady supply of molasses from the Caribbean, thus leading to the creation of a popular dish that became known as Boston baked beans (beans baked in molasses). As a city and as a name, Boston is a symbol of much that has gone into the development of the American consciousness, and its presence reaches far beyond its immediate environs. As the spiritual capital of the New England states, as the progenitor of the American Revolution and the nation, and as the earliest centre of American culture, Boston has influenced the country for some three centuries. Though Boston, like New England in general, has played a lessening role in national life since the early 20th century, it has remained the focal point of what may be the most diversified and dynamic combination of educational, cultural, medical, and scientific activities in the United States.[P2]BostonTime-lapse video of Boston.Temponaut: Sebastian Skuhra[ML2] [H3]Landscape The Boston region’s topography was largely shaped by the glaciers that covered the land during the last ice age. The city and its sheltered deepwater harbour sit in a basin that extends to Lynn in the north and Quincy in the south and is ringed by modest hills: the Middlesex Fells (north) to the Blue Hills (south). There are harder, higher surface rocks (mostly granites) on those northern and southern edges, while inside the basin the lower-lying rocks—commonly known as pudding stone—are found mostly below the surface in such areas as Roxbury, Newton, Brookline, Mattapan, West Roxbury, and Dorchester. The land, enormously compressed by the vast accumulation of glacial ice on it, has since been rebounding (rising up) at an extremely gradual rate.[P3]Boston region.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML3] Numerous drumlins (mounds of glacial debris) form low hills in the city and islands that dot the harbour. At the beginning of English settlement in the 17th century, the Shawmut Peninsula was called Trimountain (or Tramount) because of its dominating three-topped hill on the northwest corner near the mouth of the Charles River. Beacon Hill is its only surviving, though greatly reduced, remnant. The other portions were leveled to become landfill that added to the city’s area in the 19th century.[P4] Area of the colonial town The hilly Shawmut Peninsula, upon which Boston was settled, originally was almost completely surrounded by water. It was connected with mainland Roxbury to the south by a narrow neck of land along the line of present-day Washington Street. To the west of the neck were great reaches of mudflats and salt marshes that were covered by water at high tide and known collectively as the Back Bay. The Charles River flowed through the Back Bay to Boston Harbor and separated the peninsula from the mainland to the north and west. To the east, Town Cove indented Boston’s harbour front and divided the city into the North End and the South End. The centre of the colonial town was at the Old State House (built 1711–47).[P5]Boston: Paul Revere HousePaul Revere House, Boston.Photo Courtesy of MOTT[ML5] Although that original centre and the colonial South End have long been given over to offices and retail stores, a few 18th-century buildings remain: Faneuil Hall (1742–1805), the Old Corner Bookstore (1718), the Old South Meeting House (1729), and King’s Chapel (1750). The North End is the only part of the early town that has remained residential since the 1630 settlement. Colonial survivals such as the Paul Revere House (c. 1680) and Christ Church (1723)—the Old North Church from which lanterns revealed the route of the British march to Lexington in 1775—coexist with the busy life of a traditionally Italian American community.[P6]Boston: Faneuil HallFaneuil Hall, Boston.© Jorge Salcedo/Dreamstime.com[ML6] The long shoreline, only a few minutes’ walk from any part of the peninsula, provided ample space for wharves and shipyards. From the first years of settlement, the shoreline constantly encroached on the harbour as wharves were built and marshy coves were filled. West of the original settlement lay Boston Common, a tract that has remained public open space since its purchase by the town in 1634.[P7] Postcolonial expansion In the last years of the 18th century, when space in the city became scarce, a series of major changes began to transform the urban landscape. In that period of expansion, the architect Charles Bulfinch, who for more than a quarter of a century was also the head of the town government, skillfully transformed an 18th-century English town into a 19th-century American city. Bulfinch designed the central portion of the present State House (1795–98), above Boston Common on Beacon Hill. The construction of the State House on that site led to the conversion of the upland pastures of Beacon Hill into a handsome residential district that has survived with relatively little change. Between the State House and Charles Street are several streets, including famous Louisburg Square, filled with many houses by Bulfinch and other leading 19th-century architects. The area is protected by historic district legislation and has been designated as the Beacon Hill Historic District.[P8]Massachusetts State House, Boston, c. 1812; at left, workers excavating a portion of Beacon Hill.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML8] As pressures of population in the 19th century caused a growing demand for land, hills were leveled to fill in the coves. So much new land was created that the former peninsula became an indistinguishable part of the mainland. Fill on both sides of the narrow neck that connected the peninsula with the mainland created a new South End. The waterfront was greatly extended, and the Back Bay was dammed (1818–21) to create tidal power for new mill sites. A causeway along the dam extended west from Boston Common to Sewall’s Point, the present Kenmore Square, thus furnishing more-direct communication with the mainland. The filling of the Back Bay flats just west of the common created land that in the 1830s was laid out as the Public Garden. That became a splendidly planted area with an artificial pond that is still traversed by swan-shaped excursion boats in the summer.[P9]Boston Public GardenBoston Public Garden.Rick Harris (www.flickr.com/rickharris)[ML9] The Back Bay mill basins never developed as their promoters had envisioned, partly because the construction of railway lines through them in the 1830s hindered the flow of water. The basins became a foul-smelling nuisance, and the Massachusetts legislature in 1857 authorized the filling of that extensive area. The adopted plan provided for four new streets parallel to the Mill Dam (Beacon Street), to be intersected by cross streets. Commonwealth Avenue, running west from the Public Garden and 200 feet (60 metres) wide with a park between its roadways, created the atmosphere of a Parisian boulevard. Since there were no hills left to cut down, gravel had to be brought in by train from pits some distance away in Needham. By the end of the 19th century the Back Bay was completely filled and built up with houses that were subject to uniform height limits and setbacks. The region today presents a picture of American architecture that is as consistent for the second half of that century as Beacon Hill is for the first. Although many Back Bay houses have been converted to apartments, offices, schools, or other uses, the region has retained a good deal of its original character, and further changes are subject to architectural control.[P10] The Emerald Necklace When the Back Bay was nearing completion during the 1880s, the American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted developed an imaginative large-scale design for the city’s parks. It linked the common, the Public Garden, and Commonwealth Avenue with Franklin Park south of Roxbury by way of a string of parks—including the Back Bay Fens—that combined water, woods, and meadows along an open park known as the Fenway, which followed the Muddy River between central Boston and Jamaica Plain. Included in that park system, known as the Emerald Necklace, was the Arnold Arboretum, a botanical outpost of Harvard University in Jamaica Plain. About the turn of the 20th century, institutions such as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the New England Conservatory of Music, the Museum of Fine Arts, and the Harvard Medical School and hospitals moved west to locations near the Back Bay Fens. The completion in 1910 of a dam that kept the harbour tides out of the Charles River converted the remaining unfilled portion of the Back Bay into a body of fresh water. The Charles River basin—surrounded by parkland and patterned on the Alster River basin in Hamburg, Germany—remains one of the most handsome, distinctive, and popular features of Boston.[P11]Central Boston.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML11] Annexations With the end of the American Civil War in 1865, large numbers of Boston residents, many of them Irish immigrants, abandoned the congested waterfront districts and moved into the nearby suburbs. Soon many of those new districts sought to annex themselves to the city of Boston in order to obtain such services as water, sewers, schools, hospitals, police security, and fire protection. In 1868 Roxbury became a part of Boston; Dorchester followed two years later; and in 1873 Charlestown, Brighton, and West Roxbury were also annexed. The city’s population jumped from 140,000 in 1865 to 341,000 in a decade—an increase of more than 200,000 people. Once a small community of some 1.2 square miles (3.2 square km) of land, Boston is now nearly 40 times its original size. The new communities, known as neighbourhoods, became parts of the city’s ward system and were populated at first by groups of Irish Americans. Gradually, however, as new ethnic groups moved into Boston after the turn of the 20th century, they usually moved into one neighbourhood or another, making it distinctly their own. In that manner, South Boston and Charlestown were soon identified as distinctly Irish, the North End and East Boston as Italian, the Mattapan district as Jewish, and the Roxbury area as African American. Central Boston continued to be regarded as traditionally Anglo-Saxon Yankee.[P12] The contemporary city Until the mid-20th century the low skyline of Boston was punctuated only by church steeples and by the Custom House Tower (1915), which, as a federal building, was not bound by the 125-foot (38-metre) height restriction that prevailed generally in the city. Modification of the building code and a construction boom brought about great changes in the 1960s and ’70s, of which the first conspicuous example was the Prudential Center, with a 52-story tower. The first major effort in urban renewal in Boston, initiated early in 1958, led to the wholesale demolition of the West End, the displacement of people, and the disruption of neighbourhoods to make way for the apartment towers of Charles River Park. Unfavourable reaction to the total destruction of such large areas without regard for the feelings of people led the city’s redevelopment authority after 1960 to emphasize renewal rather than demolition and rebuilding. The Government Center, containing the new City Hall completed in 1968, in addition to federal, state, and private office buildings, thereby developed alongside Faneuil Hall and other adjacent historic buildings. Considerable private construction subsequently transformed much of central Boston. The John Hancock Tower, completed in 1976, overtopped the nearby Prudential Tower, while the Christian Science church (Church of Christ, Scientist) sponsored the reconstruction of large blocks of property near the First Church of Christ, Scientist (the Mother Church). Several high-rise office towers went up during the 1970s in Boston’s financial district, and downtown waterfront renewal during the 1960s and ’70s along Atlantic Avenue helped to open up the waterfront for commercial, residential, and recreational use and to preserve buildings of historical and architectural value. During the 1980s and ’90s many of Boston’s older neighbourhoods, most notably the South End, underwent extensive renovation as they drew an increasingly affluent population. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries other neighbourhoods outside the downtown area—many of which formerly had been populated by Irish and Italians—attracted increasing numbers of African American, Latino, and Asian residents.[P13]The Mother Church and reflecting pool, Christian Science Center, Boston. © Tony Arruza/CorbisBostonView of downtown Boston at night.Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.comBostonCustom House Tower and Rowes Wharf, at night, Boston, Massachusetts.Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com[ML13] The narrow and crowded streets of the central city are better suited for walking than driving, for Bostonians are incorrigible jaywalkers. The street markets around Faneuil Hall are as essential a part of the city as ever, while the surrounding modern offices and their workers provide a modern bustle and vitality.[P14]Boston: Faneuil HallView of Faneuil Hall at night, Boston.Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com[ML14] [H4]People Between 1800 and 1900 Boston changed from a relatively simple and ethnically homogeneous seaport of some 24,000 inhabitants (mainly of English ancestry) to a city with a much more diverse population of more than 560,000. The burgeoning of the city’s population during the 19th century was the result of a succession of immigrant waves that increased the total by at least one-fourth in each decade from 1810 to 1900. While the Irish were the most important immigrant group during the 19th century, from the late 1880s through the 1910s Boston also received a new wave of immigrants, mainly from southern and eastern Europe, including Italians and Jews. The traditional Yankee elite, of mainly English origin, remained in the central Boston neighbourhoods of Beacon Hill and Back Bay and dominated many of the city’s economic institutions, while Irish, Italian, Jewish, and other immigrant groups occupied many of the outlying neighbourhoods and gained control over the city’s political life.[P15]Italian business occupying house of Revolutionary patriot Paul Revere, early 1900s, Boston.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML15] Boston’s ethnic patterns changed considerably after World War II with the growth of the city’s African American population. In the early 20th century a relatively small black community was centred in the South End, but between 1940 and 1960 many African Americans migrated from Southern states and occupied portions of Roxbury and Dorchester. From the 1940s through the ’70s many Puerto Ricans arrived in Boston. Beginning in the late 1970s, a renewed wave of immigration brought further changes to the city’s population. Most recently, the largest groups of immigrants came from the Caribbean islands (particularly Haiti), from Central and South America, and from Asia (notably China and Vietnam), and they settled in the city’s outlying neighbourhoods, as descendants of earlier immigrants moved to the suburbs. Ireland is still one of the single largest sources of immigrants, although that trend began slowing and even reversing in the early 21st century, when crackdowns on illegal immigration and stricter enforcement of existing regulations began affecting all immigrant groups.[P16] [H5]Economy Finance and industry During the 19th century, industrial textile mills and shipbuilding concerns augmented the shipping and commerce that had dominated Boston’s colonial economy. Investments in banking and railroads provided additional sources of wealth, while shipping lost importance during the mid-19th century. Railroad investments and the textile industry dominated the regional economy until the Great Depression of the 1930s, when textile factories moved to the South in search of cheaper labour and raw materials. During World War II Boston’s universities provided a source of scientific and technological talent to war-related industries, and Boston changed from “mill-based” to “mind-based” industries, with major corporations dominating electronics, telecommunications, and digital research. Later, Boston firms took the lead in software design, computer architecture, data processing, and biomedical technologies. Boston banks created high-technology investment companies connected with global financial institutions that made the city a world leader in equity fund management. Boston’s universities remained an important part of the city’s economy, and their medical schools and hospitals gave the city an especially robust health care sector.[P17] Transportation The Boston Post Road, consisting of three routes, was one of the most heavily traveled of the early roadways. It opened to mail delivery between Boston and New York City in 1673. Today the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority maintains a network of public subway, elevated, and surface lines. The subway system, begun in 1897, was the first in the country.[P18] Some of the Boston region’s other transportation facilities are under state control. The Massachusetts Port Authority, for example, operates Logan International Airport in East Boston—a busy centre for overseas as well as domestic flights—along with several regional airports. The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority supervises the operations of Interstate 90, the highway extending westward from Boston to New York state. The Metropolitan District Commission manages a system of regional parks and roadways.[P19] Boston has not easily accommodated the growth of private automobile and truck traffic, which increasingly chokes the city, especially the narrow and winding downtown streets laid out in colonial times. For decades one of the city’s weakest points in terms of traffic flow was the Central Artery, a six-lane elevated highway opened in 1959 that cut through downtown and isolated neighbourhoods. Increasingly, it became clear that the Central Artery was becoming unable to cope with continually growing vehicular traffic, and a major construction project—the Central Artery/Tunnel Project, commonly called the Big Dig—was begun in 1991. The task involved replacing the elevated highway through the city with an 8-to-10-lane underground expressway, rebuilding bridges, and boring a new tunnel under the harbour; the need to do so without crippling the city’s essential functions and day-to-day life made it one of the most-challenging infrastructure projects ever undertaken in the United States. Major construction on the Big Dig was completed in 2006, providing greater access to the formerly undeveloped South Boston waterfront area. There a newly created Seaport District featured a large convention centre, an international trade centre, the Institute of Contemporary Art, and a series of hotels, restaurants, and residential buildings.[P20] [H6]Administration and society Government Throughout the colonial period Boston was governed by a town meeting to which representatives of the community were regularly elected. In 1822, after a popular referendum, Boston became a city and acquired a city government. All “fiscal, prudential, and municipal concerns” of the city were vested in the mayor, a committee of eight persons called the Board of Aldermen, and a Common Council of 48 members elected from the various wards of the city.[P21] That system endured until 1909, when a new city charter was approved. The Board of Aldermen was abolished, and the council was reduced in size to nine at-large members. Mayoral elections were put on a nonpartisan basis, and the office of mayor was greatly strengthened by giving the incumbent a four-year term. With minor variations, the system continues to operate.[P22] Boston is unique among the cities in the Bay State for the restrictions that have been placed on its power to manage its own finances and control its own regulatory agencies. In 1909, fearing municipal corruption, the Republican-controlled state legislature placed severe restrictions on local rule. The state created an independent finance commission to oversee the city’s management and budget as well as to control the appointment of the city’s police commissioner and members of the licensing board. Perhaps the most-influential local authority in later years has been the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which directed major urban development projects during the 1960s and ’70s.[P23] Municipal services During the 19th century Boston organized its fire and police departments, established municipal services to centralize water supplies and safeguard public health, and authorized a public works department to lay out streets and construct roads and bridges. In the 20th century, however, with the rapid expansion of the city and its surrounding urban communities, the Greater Boston area came to depend on various state authorities, commissions, and quasi-public agencies for many vital resources. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, for example, coordinates the sewer and waterworks system that supplies more than 60 cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts.[P24] Education and health Universities, colleges, and schools of every kind fill several pages in the classified section of the Boston telephone directory. Boston University (founded 1869), Northeastern University (1898), Suffolk University (1906), and the Boston campus (1964) of the University of Massachusetts, as well as Simmons (1899), Emmanuel (1919), and Emerson (1880) colleges, are based within the city, as are the Harvard University faculties of medicine, dentistry, public health, and business administration.[P25]Harvard Business SchoolBaker Library at Harvard Business School, Harvard University, Boston.© Jorge Salcedo/Shutterstock.com[ML25] The rest of Harvard (1636) and Radcliffe College (1879; now the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT; 1861) are just across the Charles River in Cambridge. Boston College (1863), a Jesuit institution that is a university in everything except name, was founded in Boston proper but is now in the Chestnut Hill neighbourhood of Newton, only a step beyond the city limits. Tufts University (1852), although based in Medford, has its medical school in Boston.

The original farming community was part of the town of Bridgewater until 1821 and was called North Bridgewater until being renamed for Brockton, Ontario, Canada, in 1874. Shoe manufacturing began there as early as 1750, and by 1865, with the development of the McKay sewing machine (enabling the stitching of the uppers and soles of shoes) and the demand created by the American Civil War, Brockton had become a major boot-producing centre; shoemaking had declined in importance, however, by the 1950s.

Originally settled as New Towne in 1630 by the Massachusetts Bay Company, it was organized as a town in 1636 when it became the site of Harvard College (now an undergraduate school of Harvard University). The town was renamed for Cambridge, England, in 1638 and became a county seat in 1643. The old part of Cambridge (around Harvard Square) is regarded as a symbol of American culture and history. It was there that the general synods of the New England churches met in 1637 and 1647 to settle disputed points of doctrine and, from there, that the Reverend Thomas Hooker’s congregation departed for Connecticut in 1636. At the outbreak of the American Revolution, the first American army camped at what is now Cambridge Common, where George Washington assumed leadership of the Continental forces on July 3, 1775. The first Massachusetts Constitutional Convention met in Cambridge in 1779–80.[P1]CambridgeCambridge, Mass.Shinkukin[ML1]Early industrial development was slow. Stephen Day (Daye) set up the first printing press in the British colonies at Cambridge in 1638 (forerunner of the city’s modern publishing and printing industry), and the first books to be printed in America came from this press. After completion (1912) of subway connections to Boston, the city experienced rapid industrial expansion. Most manufacturing industries had declined in importance by the late 20th century, but they were replaced by firms developing computer software, electronics, and biotechnology. Photographic equipment and other light manufactures are produced, but services predominate. Institutes of higher education are the largest employers.[P2]Scientific and industrial research is stimulated by the presence of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (founded in Boston in 1861 and moved to Cambridge in 1916).

Massachusetts"Clinton"Town"Worcester county"central Massachusetts"Clinton, town (township), Worcester county, central Massachusetts, U.S. It lies along the south branch of the Nashua River, just north of Wachusett Reservoir, 13 miles (21 km) north of Worcester. Settled in 1654 as part of Lancaster, it was separately incorporated in 1850 and named for the statesman DeWitt Clinton. The manufacture of lace (for stagecoach windows), employing modern factory methods, was of early economic importance. In 1843 Horatio and Erastus Bigelow built a mill there for the manufacture of gingham (striped or checked cotton cloth). A few years later, the Bigelow carpet mills were also established. The town developed around these two plants, which existed until the early 1930s. Among the manufactures now produced are plastic molds, wire and cable, and electrical machinery. Commercial printing is important, as are health care and other services. Atlantic Union College (1922) is a Seventh-day Adventist institution located in nearby South Lancaster.

Massachusetts"Cohasset"Town"Norfolk county"eastern Massachusetts"Cohasset, town (township), Norfolk county, eastern Massachusetts, U.S. It lies along Massachusetts Bay, about 20 miles (30 km) southeast of Boston. Captain John Smith supposedly landed there in 1614, and the site, settled about 1647, was a part of Hingham until its incorporation in 1770. The name is a contraction of the Algonquian word Quonohassit (Conohasset), probably meaning “rocky promontory” or “high place.” Now a popular resort and yachting centre, its early economic mainstays were cod and mackerel fishing and farming. The town is the home of the South Shore Music Circus, featuring Broadway players. Numerous shipwrecks on the coast resulted in construction of the first permanent U.S. lifeboat station (1807) on Pleasant Beach, with boats operated by volunteer crews. An offshore lighthouse at Minot’s Ledge was built in 1850 but destroyed in a gale in April 1851; the present Minot’s Ledge Lighthouse has been maintained since 1860.

Massachusetts"Concord"Town"Middlesex county"eastern Massachusetts"Concord, town (township), Middlesex county, eastern Massachusetts, U.S. It lies along the Concord River, 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Boston. Founded and incorporated in 1635 as Musketaquid, it was the first Puritan settlement away from tidewater and ocean commerce; later that year it was renamed Concord, indicative of peaceful agreements with Native Americans. In 1774 the first county convention to denounce the “Coercion Acts” (which deprived Massachusetts of its charter and the right to choose its own magistrate) met there, followed by the convening of the first and second Massachusetts provincial congresses.[P1]The home of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Concord, Mass.J. Latta/Photo Researchers[ML1]Concord shares with nearby Lexington the honour of opening the military phase of the American Revolution. (See Lexington and Concord, Battles of.) Following the initial skirmish at Lexington, British soldiers entered Concord on April 19, 1775, for the purpose of destroying arms and ammunition collected by the Americans, but, forewarned by Paul Revere, the residents had already removed most of the supplies. Minutemen met the British at the North Bridge, and the resultant gunfire was immortalized by the poet and transcendentalist philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson in the “Concord Hymn,” excerpted here:[P2]North Bridge, Concord, Mass.Courtesy of MOTT[ML2]By the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood, And fired the shot heard round the world.During the 19th century, Concord was a noted cultural centre, being the home of Emerson, the naturalist Henry David Thoreau, the sculptor Daniel Chester French, and the authors Nathaniel Hawthorne and Louisa May Alcott (all buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery). The Concord Summer School of Philosophy (founded by A. Bronson Alcott, father of Louisa) met there from 1879 to 1888. About 1850 Ephraim Bull perfected the Concord grape, marking the beginning of commercial cultivation of table grapes in the United States.[P3]Concord was a small farming community until the beginning of the 20th century; it is now primarily residential with services and diversified manufacturing (including computerized diagnostic systems, electronics, and metallurgical products). The town preserves its early American character, and tourism is important. Of special interest are the Minute Man National Historical Park (including the reconstructed North Bridge and French’s famous bronze Minuteman Statue), the Concord Museum (containing relics of the Revolution, a collection of Thoreau’s belongings, and the contents of Emerson’s study), Walden Pond State Reservation, and the homes of Emerson, Hawthorne, and the Alcotts.

Massachusetts"Danvers"Town"Essex county"eastern Massachusetts"Danvers, town (township), Essex county, eastern Massachusetts, U.S. It lies just northeast of Boston. Founded in the 1630s by Governor John Endecott, it was part of Salem and originally known as Salem Village (site of the witchcraft hysteria of 1692). Set off from Salem as a district in 1752, it was incorporated in 1775 (a 1757 act of incorporation had been invalidated because of supposed opposition by the British king George II) and renamed for the Danvers Osborne family of New York. In 1855 South Danvers became a separate town, and it was renamed Peabody in 1868. Shoemaking, carpet making, and brickmaking were early industries. The service sector accounts for the largest share of employment in Danvers, but electronic equipment, lamps, computer software, and telecommunications equipment are also produced. Danvers is the site of North Shore Community College (1965). Many colonial homes have been restored, and the town is the birthplace of the Revolutionary War leader General Israel Putnam.

In December 1620 a shore party of Mayflower Pilgrims landed at the Cape Cod Bay site near the entrance to Wellfleet Harbor and had their first encounter with Native Americans, the Nausets. The meeting is commemorated by a memorial stone adjoining First Encounter Beach. In 1644 Thomas Prence (or Prince), with more than 40 other colonists from Plymouth, returned and organized a settlement known as Nauset, which was incorporated in 1651 and renamed, probably for Eastham, England, or for the settlement’s easterly location. The town’s Old Cove Burial Ground contains the graves of early Pilgrims. After the American Revolution, fishing and coastal trade flourished, but by the mid-19th century farming dominated. The town is now a summer resort and tourist base for Nauset Light Beach, Coast Guard Beach, and other parts of Cape Cod National Seashore.

After 1740 the community (then part of New Bedford and known as Oxford) was a centre of whaling operations. Herman Melville sailed (1841) from Fairhaven on the Acushnet on a voyage that inspired his first adventure novel, Typee (1846). With the decline of whaling in the mid-19th century, fishing and boatbuilding became the economic mainstays. Fairhaven was the home port of Captain Joshua Slocum, the first man to circumnavigate the globe alone (1895–98); he recounted his adventures in Sailing Alone Around the World (1900).

Originally part of Freetown, it was separately incorporated as the town of Fallriver in 1803. Renamed Troy, it reverted (1831) to its earlier name (derived from the Algonquian term Quequechan, meaning “Falling Water”). Abundant waterpower, a fine harbour, and a moist climate encouraged textile milling in the town as early as 1811, and by 1871 the city was a leading cotton-textile centre. It was the scene of numerous labour strikes, and its millworkers played a prominent role in the American labour-union movement.

Massachusetts"Lowell"City"Middlesex county"northeastern Massachusetts"Lowell, city, Middlesex county, northeastern Massachusetts, U.S. It lies at the junction of the Concord and Merrimack rivers, 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Boston. It was the country’s first planned industrial town.[P1]Lowell: Boott Cotton Mills MuseumBoott Cotton Mills Museum, Lowell National Historical Park, Lowell, Massachusetts.Jlpapple[ML1]The site was originally settled in 1653 as a farming community known as East Chelmsford. Beginning in the early 19th century, the village grew to become a major centre of cotton textile manufacturing, with an abundance of waterpower from the Merrimack’s Pawtucket Falls (32 feet [10 metres]) and the completion of the Middlesex Canal link to Boston in 1803. By 1824 the locality was crisscrossed by a canal system that served numerous cotton textile mills along the Merrimack River. The community was incorporated as a town in 1826 and was named for Francis Cabot Lowell, a pioneer textile industrialist who was influenced by the organizational reforms of Robert Owen. Lowell’s mills gained attention and renown for being staffed by the so-called “mill girls,” young women predominantly from neighbouring rural communities who were given the opportunity to pursue gainful employment. The town’s growth was further sustained by the completion of the Boston and Lowell Railroad in 1835.[P2]By the mid-19th century Lowell had become one of the country’s major industrial cities; it was called the “spindle city” and the “Manchester of America” because of its large textile industries. As such it aroused the interest of European writers such as Charles Dickens and Anthony Trollope, who recorded their impressions of it. By mid-century the mill girls had begun to be replaced by successive immigrant groups. The Irish came first and then French Canadians in the 1860s and ’70s, followed by eastern and southern European immigrants—including Greeks, Poles, and Lithuanians—by the century’s end. The city’s peak as a textile centre was reached about 1924.[P3]Following a period of decline and eventual relocation of the textile mills to Southern states, Lowell’s economy stagnated through the middle of the 20th century. However, the city’s fortunes began to change with the establishment of Lowell National Historical Park in 1978, commemorating the first American textile mills and saving much of the historic downtown, which included the majority of the vacant mills, from demolition. An influx of immigrants from Southeast Asia, primarily refugees from Cambodia, that began in the late 1970s contributed to making Lowell one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the United States by the end of the 20th century. Many of the former mills have been converted either to museums or to residential and artist space. By the early 21st century, technology, health care, higher education, tourism, and the arts had become the city’s main economic activities.[P4]Lowell is the birthplace of the artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler, author and poet Jack Kerouac, actor Michael Chiklis, and professional boxer Micky Ward. There are two prominent institutions of higher education there: the University of Massachusetts Lowell (1991; formerly the University of Lowell, which emerged in 1975 from the amalgamation of Lowell State College and the Lowell Technological Institute, each of which had origins in the 1890s) and a campus of Middlesex Community College (1970; Lowell campus established 1991). Two festivals honouring Kerouac are held annually, one in March to commemorate his birthday and another in October. The Lowell Folk Festival, which began in 1990, features traditional music along with arts and crafts. Inc. city, 1836. Pop. (2000) 105,167; (2010) 106,519.[P5] [END-OF-CONTENT]

A fishing community was established there in 1760. By 1765 it had developed into a small whaling port and shipbuilding centre. The Dartmouth, which in 1767 was the first ship launched there, was one of the “tea-ships” involved in the Boston Tea Party (1773). Because the town’s deepwater harbour was used by American privateers during the American Revolution, it was attacked (September 5, 1778) and burned by British forces. Following a rapid recovery, it was separately incorporated (1787) as the town of New Bedford.[P2]By 1820 New Bedford was one of the world’s leading whaling ports; in the mid-19th century three-fifths of the U.S. whaling fleet, which totaled more than 700 vessels, was registered there. The site was immortalized by Herman Melville in Moby Dick.[P3]Following the decline in whaling, New Bedford turned to the manufacture of cotton fabrics but was adversely affected by the movement of the textile industry to the American Southeast during the 1920s. A diversified economy now prevails with the manufacture of electrical equipment and machinery, rubber goods, textiles and clothing, photography supplies, golf balls, and metal goods. Services and trade are also important. The city is a sailing point for the Cape Cod area and continues to be a major fishing port.[P4]The New Bedford Whaling Museum, the 19th-century fishing schooner Ernestina, and the Seamen’s Bethel (Whaleman’s Chapel) reflect the city’s historic and seafaring past.

Settled in 1635 (as part of Newbury), its location attracted early fishing, shipbuilding, and craft industries and led to its incorporation as a separate town in 1764. Its sheltered harbour was home port for a large merchant fleet that brought wealth to the town in the years prior to the American Revolution. The Jefferson Embargo of 1807–08 (against all foreign trade), a disastrous fire in 1811, and the War of 1812 set a decline in motion that ended the town’s importance as a commercial port. A brief economic boom was experienced during the 1840s when local shipyards produced several famous clipper ships under the direction of Donald McKay.

The town was founded by Pilgrims (separatists from the Church of England) who, in their search for religious toleration, had immigrated first to the Netherlands and then to North America. Sailing in the Mayflower from Plymouth, England, the settlers reached the shores of Cape Cod in November 1620, and an exploring party arrived in the Plymouth area on December 21 (now celebrated as Forefathers’ Day). According to tradition, the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock on December 26 and built their first fort and watchtower on Burial Hill (so called because it contains the graves of Governor William Bradford and others of the original group). Half their number died that first winter and were buried on Cole’s Hill, which was later leveled and planted in grain so that the Native Americans could not judge the extent of the colony’s depletion. Although never officially incorporated, the town was recognized in 1633 as the seat of Plymouth colony, which was absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1691.[P1]Plymouth Rock: porticoPlymouth Rock, under a portico designed by the firm of McKim, Mead & White, in Plymouth, Massachusetts.Courtesy of MOTT[ML1]Its seaside location and historic associations make Plymouth an outstanding summer resort.

It is located among sand dunes within a fishhook-shaped harbour that was visited by the explorers Bartholomew Gosnold in 1602 and Henry Hudson in 1609. Before the Pilgrims founded Plymouth, they landed there on Nov. 11, 1620 (Old Style), an event that is now commemorated on Nov. 21 (New Style). It was on board the Mayflower in Provincetown harbour that the Mayflower Compact, establishing general lines for the colony’s government, was signed and where the first European child in New England (Peregrine White) was born. The Pilgrim Monument (252 feet [78 metres] high and built in 1907–10) and Provincetown Museum (both on High Pole Hill) commemorate these events. Traders and fishermen settled the site prior to 1700; the community, known as the Precinct of Cape Cod or Province Lands, was part of Truro until it was separately incorporated in 1727 as Provincetown. Exposed to repeated seaborne attacks, it was abandoned during the French and Indian Wars (1754–63) and the American Revolution (1775–83). Its harbour was used by the British as a naval base during the Revolution and during the War of 1812.[P1]ProvincetownProvincetown, Mass.Phillip Capper[ML1]As an active whaling and fishing port in the 19th century, Provincetown attracted large numbers of Portuguese fishermen, whose descendants still maintain a fleet there.

The first Congregational Church in America was organized there in 1629, and Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island colony, served as an early pastor. The town’s name is probably the shortened form of the biblical Jerusalem (“City of Peace”). Salem’s early history was clouded by religious intolerance that led to the witchcraft trials of 1692. During the 18th and 19th centuries, it developed as one of New England’s leading maritime and shipbuilding centres, and during the American Revolution (1775–83) and the War of 1812 its port served as a privateers’ base. After the decline in foreign commerce, due mainly to the shallowness of its harbour, the community turned to the production of textiles, leather, and shoes.

William Pynchon, one of the original patentees of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded a settlement (now Agawam) on the river’s west bank in 1635. The colonists’ livestock did so much damage to the Native Americans’ cornfields, however, that the community moved to the present east-bank site in 1636. It was incorporated as a town in 1636 and named for Pynchon’s birthplace in England. Pynchon’s autocratic rule ended in 1652, when he returned to England after being condemned by the Massachusetts General Court for a book attacking the Calvinist doctrine of atonement. The town was nearly destroyed by Native Americans in 1675, during King Philip’s War.[P1]Basketball Hall of Fame, Springfield, Massachusetts.Mark Sexton[ML1]Springfield’s transformation from a farming to a manufacturing community was hastened by the building of an arsenal in 1777, which supplied arms during the American Revolution and was a target of attack during Shays’s Rebellion in 1786. During the American Civil War the Armory (built 1794 and now a national historic site) produced the well-known Springfield muskets; it became a principal manufactory of small arms and later developed the Springfield and Garand rifles.

One of the four earliest Massachusetts Bay settlements, it was founded by a group led by Sir Richard Saltonstall and was incorporated as a town in 1630; it was the first inland farming town. Its name may have derived from the fact that the area was well watered and abounded with fish. Construction of gristmills (1630s) and a cloth-fulling mill (1660s) were antecedents of a manufacturing economy. In 1632 the freemen of Watertown displayed an early independent spirit by refusing to pay a tax of £60 levied for fortifications at New Towne (Cambridge). The city claims to be the “cradle of the town meeting,” as the first board of selectmen was elected there in August 1634.

Michigan"Bay City"City"Bay county"east-central Michigan"Bay City, city, seat (1857) of Bay county, east-central Michigan, U.S. It lies along the Saginaw River near the river’s outlet into Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron), about 13 miles (21 km) north of Saginaw. Settlers from the United States began to arrive in the area in the 1830s; Bay City originated as a trading post established on the east side of the Saginaw and was originally called Lower Saginaw. In 1857 it received its present name. Three villages on the west side of the river were consolidated in 1877 as West Bay City, which was in turn annexed by Bay City in 1905. The community thrived during the Michigan lumber boom (1850–90), but, when the local pine forests were depleted and the mills closed, it turned to soft-coal mining, commercial fishing, and beet-sugar refining. The city’s economy is now geared toward tourism, agriculture (potatoes, beans, and beets, along with produce for local consumption), and industry, notably the manufacture of power shovels, cement, auto equipment, and plastics. Shipbuilding (of both commercial and recreational vessels) is also important. With deepwater harbour facilities, it is a port for Great Lakes and ocean shipping.[P1]The city has several riverside parks, and along the bay shore are amusement parks, bathing beaches, and summer cottages. The river and bay are heavily used for boating and fishing. The Trombley House (1836), the city’s first frame structure, was relocated in 1981 from the east side of the Saginaw River to Veterans Memorial Park, on the west side; it is maintained there as a museum. A number of well-preserved Victorian-style mansions from the timber-boom era are also among the city’s many historic buildings. Bay City State Park is 5 miles (8 km) north of the city.

Michigan"Detroit"City"Wayne county"southeastern Michigan"Detroit, city, seat of Wayne county, southeastern Michigan, U.S. It is located on the Detroit River (connecting Lakes Erie and St. Clair) opposite Windsor, Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1701 by a French trader, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, who built a fort on the river and named it Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit in honour of his patron (the French word détroit meaning “strait”); later the British called it simply Detroit. In the 20th century the city’s name became synonymous with the American automotive industry. Pop.

The downtown area retains vestiges of a hexagonal street pattern laid out early in the 19th century that largely disappeared as the city expanded. Most of the city’s commercial and civic buildings are concentrated in the downtown area near the river and include the City-County Building; Cobo Hall, a convention and exhibit building; Cobo Arena; and the Renaissance Center (completed in 1977), which includes a 73-story hotel. Many of the city’s museums and the public library, however, are located about 2 miles (3 km) to the northwest in the Detroit Cultural Center. Suburbs ring Detroit, and the city completely surrounds the communities of Hamtramck and Highland Park.[P2]The Renaissance Center, along the Detroit River in Detroit, Mich.Colour Library International[ML2] [H3]The people and economy Detroit’s population grew dramatically between 1850 and 1950. The city’s industrial growth was a magnet for migrants, at first chiefly European immigrants and later African Americans from the South. The population has declined steadily since the mid-1950s, however, in part because much of the white community moved to the suburbs and also because of the loss of industry. By the early 21st century, some four-fifths of the population was African American.[P3] Detroit has a diversified manufacturing and shipping base, but the city’s economy remains unusually sensitive to the fortunes of the automotive industry. As a result, economic booms and depressions have been felt more heavily in Detroit than in most areas of the country. In addition to motor vehicles and automotive parts, the city’s factories produce machinery (including industrial robots), steel, and chemicals. The service sector has become increasingly important.[P4] Roads dominate Detroit’s transportation system and include an extensive network of express highways. The Detroit People Mover, a light-rail system serving the central business district, was completed in 1987. It was originally intended to serve as part of a regional transit system. However, the required funding never materialized; few were willing to campaign for rail transit in a city that was tied so closely to the automobile, and the People Mover became little more than a curiosity for tourists. The city is connected to Windsor by a bridge and a tunnel. The Detroit River is heavily used by Great Lakes shipping, and the region’s port facilities handle large quantities of raw materials. Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport is located about 17 miles (27 km) southwest of downtown.[P5] [H4]Cultural life Among the colleges and universities in the city are Wayne State University (1868) and the University of Detroit Mercy (1877). Important cultural institutions include Cranbrook Academy of Art in suburban Bloomfield Hills and the Detroit Institute of Arts. The Motown Historical Museum preserves the house where Berry Gordy, Jr., founded the Motown Record Corporation and tells the story of the creation of the classic soul music produced there. The Henry Ford Museum in suburban Dearborn holds an extensive collection of transportation equipment, while the adjoining Greenfield Village contains reconstructions of 19th-century American buildings and exhibits of traditional crafts. Since 1914 Detroit has maintained a symphony orchestra; summer concerts are presented at the Meadow Brook Music Festival in nearby Rochester. Belle Isle Park, in the Detroit River, has a botanical garden, a children’s zoo, and an aquarium. The city’s professional sports teams include the Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Tigers of Major League Baseball’s American League, the Lions of the National Football League, and the Red Wings, who have been such a dominant force in the National Hockey League that Detroit was dubbed “Hockeytown, U.S.A.”[P6]Park in downtown Detroit, Mich.© Index OpenDetroit Institute of ArtsDetroit Institute of Arts.UrbanWayne State University, Detroit, Mich.Mike Russell[ML6] [H5]History In the early 18th century Detroit became an important fur-trading post. In 1760, during the French and Indian War, it was surrendered to the British. France’s Indian allies, notably the Ottawa under Chief Pontiac, tried to capture the fort in 1763 but were defeated. The Jay Treaty (November 19, 1794) provided for the evacuation of the U.S. control.[P7] In 1805 Detroit became the capital of the newly created Michigan Territory. In that same year a fire destroyed many buildings, and the town had to be rebuilt. Soon after the outbreak of the War of 1812, Detroit was again surrendered to the British, but the Americans recaptured it in September 1813. In 1815 Detroit was incorporated as a city.[P8] In 1818 the first steamboat on the upper Great Lakes began regular runs between Buffalo, New York, and Detroit. Grain and other agricultural produce poured into the city by rail and water for processing and forwarding to other parts of the United States and to Europe. Detroit became one of the flour-milling centres of the country. It was the capital of the state of Michigan from its creation in 1837 until 1847, when the capital was moved to Lansing.[P9] Following the American Civil War (1861–65), Detroit changed from its early role as a rural merchant to that of industrial magnate. It became the automobile capital of the world with the help of the manufacturer Henry Ford, who introduced the assembly line in 1914. Detroit’s industrial development accelerated during World War I, when it was an important producer of military armaments, and it attracted a large number of migrants, particularly African Americans from the South. In 1943 fighting broke out between whites and blacks in the city, and racial tension continued to be an issue in subsequent decades, often manifesting as “white flight,” the departure of whites from Detroit proper to the surrounding suburbs.[P10]Ford Motor Company plant, River Rouge, west of Detroit, Michigan, c. 1930s. Built between 1917 and 1925, it became the model for assembly-line production, turning parts at one end into finished cars at the other.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML10] Sparked by a police raid on an unlicensed after-hours drinking establishment on July 23, 1967, five days of unchecked rioting in the city left 43 dead, almost 1,200 injured, and huge swaths of property destroyed by looting or fire before order was restored by the police, National Guardsmen, and U.S. Army troops. In the wake of the riot, white flight accelerated, and the sense of desperation and hopelessness that gripped the inner city was perhaps most clearly seen in Devil’s Night—a pre-Halloween tradition “celebrated” with looting and arson.[P11] Many saw the election in 1973 of Detroit’s first African American mayor, Coleman Young, who would serve an unprecedented five terms, as a turning point. The construction of the Renaissance Center in 1977 rejuvenated the city’s declining riverfront. However, it failed to serve as an anchor for wider development, and the loss of jobs in the automotive industry brought new economic hardship and social problems. Moreover, in the last two decades of the 20th century, Detroit continued to suffer economically, and by the mid-1990s its population had fallen to half its peak in the 1950s.[P12] As part of efforts by Young’s successor, Dennis Archer, to rebrand the city as a desirable destination for suburbanites, millions of dollars were spent on infrastructure, casino gambling was legalized along the Detroit River, and new stadiums were erected for the Lions (who had played in suburban Pontiac since 1975) and for the Tigers. Scandals plagued the tenure of the city’s next mayor, populist Kwame Kilpatrick, who was elected at age 31 but forced to resign in 2008 during his second term. Kilpatrick, who was briefly incarcerated for obstruction of justice in 2008, was later accused of having abused the power of the mayor’s office. In March 2013 he was convicted of multiple counts, including bribery, racketeering, and extortion, and he was ultimately sentenced to 28 years in prison.[P13]Detroit: Comerica ParkComerica Park, home of the Detroit Tigers.© Steven Pepple/Shutterstock.com[ML13] In May 2009 former Pistons star Dave Bing was elected to complete Kilpatrick’s final months in office; in November of that year, Bing was reelected to a full four-year term. Faced with a city whose population had declined by one-fourth over the previous decade, Bing embarked on a dramatic plan to turn Detroit around. He shifted city dollars away from distressed neighbourhoods, essentially allowing them to wither on the vine, in an effort to encourage people to move to more stable areas. However, as the city’s financial situation continued to spiral downward, it became a challenge to provide even the most basic of municipal services.[P14] In March 2013 Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder appointed Kevyn Orr, an attorney who had participated in the bankruptcy and restructuring of Chrysler in 2009, to be Detroit’s emergency manager. Orr was granted wide-ranging executive powers to deal with the city’s $19 billion debt, but he was unable to reach an agreement with the city’s creditors; chief among them were the holders of municipal bonds and the public employees who were entitled to retirement benefits. In July 2013 Orr submitted a claim for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection for Detroit, the largest such claim ever filed for a U.S. city. Bing—who had seen much of his mayoral authority transferred to Orr—announced that he would not seek another term, and that November voters elected Mike Duggan, a former Wayne county executive, as mayor. Duggan, who had orchestrated financial turnarounds at numerous Detroit-area organizations, was the city’s first white mayor in nearly 40 years. In finding the city eligible for bankruptcy in December 2013, a federal judge stated that cuts to municipal pensions would be legally permissible, although he criticized the city for failing to negotiate with its creditors in good faith. When Detroit officially emerged from bankruptcy in December 2014, Orr resigned, and control of the city’s operations reverted to Duggan and the city council.[P15]Detroit: abandoned houseAn abandoned house in Detroit's once-thriving Brush Park neighbourhood, 2013.

Michigan"Flint"City"Genesee county"eastern Michigan"Flint, city, seat (1836) of Genesee county, eastern Michigan, U.S. It lies along the Flint River, 60 miles (100 km) northwest of Detroit. It originated in 1819 as a trading post opened by Jacob Smith. Laid out beginning in 1830 and named for the river (which the Native Americans called Pawanunking, “River of Flint”), the settlement progressed as a fur-trading, lumbering, and agricultural centre. Abundant local supplies of timber led to the development in 1886 of the Durant-Dort Carriage Company, and by 1900 Flint was producing more than 100,000 horse-drawn vehicles a year. The body, spring, and wheel companies of the carriage industry became suppliers for the Buick Motor Company, which moved from Detroit to Flint in 1903. The next year Buick came under the direction of William C. Durant, who in 1908 consolidated Flint’s major manufacturing resources into the General Motors Company. In 1936–37 the General Motors plant was the site of a three-month sit-down strike by workers protesting deteriorating working conditions at the plant; the strike settlement, negotiated by the United Automobile Workers of America, helped to establish that union as the bargaining agent for most American autoworkers and as an important force within labour relations.[P1]FlintThe Flint Institute of Arts, Flint, Mich.Connor Coyne[ML1]The city’s growth paralleled the success of the automotive industry, and by the 1950s it was the site of the largest single manufacturing complex of General Motors. Flint became second only to Detroit in the manufacture of automobiles, auto parts, and supplies in the United States. However, the closing or relocation elsewhere of various General Motors plants in Flint in the 1980s and early ’90s left the city with a shrinking economy and dwindling population. Those plant closings and the economic and social devastation they caused the residents of Flint were the subject of the documentary film Roger & Me (1989), by Flint native Michael Moore. Flint again became the focus of national attention in the 2010s when gross mismanagement of the city’s water supply led to a crisis that left residents exposed to dangerous levels of lead.[P2]Flint, MichiganA bottle of water taken from Flint's contaminated municipal supply, held by a protester outside Michigan Gov.

A fur-trading post was built on the site in 1834; the village of Grand Haven was laid out the next year. With the construction of several sawmills on the river, it soon developed into an active centre for lumbering. Shipbuilding and fishing became important industries in the 1850s, and in 1858 the town became a ferry port on the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad. The discovery in 1870 of mineral-rich springs in the area encouraged the city’s growth as a resort. With the decline of the timber trade at the end of the 19th century, Grand Haven’s economy came to rely on these newer economic activities, as well as on a growing fruit market. Its fine natural harbour handles shipments of sand, gravel, crushed limestone, coal, and petroleum; it is also used for commercial fishing and is the site of a U.S. Coast Guard base. The city’s manufactures include auto parts, furniture, metal products, and industrial equipment.[P1]Outer (background) and inner (foreground) South Pierhead lighthouses, Grand Haven, Mich.Ira Block—National Geographic/Getty Images[ML1]Grand Haven is a popular tourist destination; its attractions include beaches, fishing, golf, and two historic lighthouses on the south pier.

Michigan"Grand Rapids"City"Kent county"western Michigan"Grand Rapids, city, seat (1836) of Kent county, western Michigan, U.S. It is situated along the Grand River, 25 miles (40 km) east of Lake Michigan and about 30 miles (50 km) southeast of Muskegon. It was founded in 1826 by Frenchman Louis Campau as a trading post where several important Ottawa Indian trails (which are now diagonal streets) converged at the rapids on the Grand River. Ample waterpower generated by the 18-foot (5.5-metre) fall of the river and the availability of valuable lumber from nearby pine and hardwood forests resulted in the establishment of a number of sawmills and woodworking (especially furniture-making) industries in the town.[P1]Grand RapidsGrand Rapids, Mich.Grguy2011[ML1]Following the display of Grand Rapids furniture at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876, the city gained a reputation as the furniture capital of America. Buyers the world over went to its furniture markets, first held in 1878. The diversification of its industry began with the advent of World War I, and metal-based manufacturing industries thereafter exceeded furniture in value and output. Nevertheless, Grand Rapids furniture produced by skilled craftsmen has maintained its eminence in quality, style, and design. Grand Rapids has become the state’s second largest city and is the principal trading centre of western Michigan, including a large area devoted to fruit farming and truck gardening.[P2]The city’s Public Museum (a complex founded in 1854 as a gift of the lumber baron T. Stewart White) includes historical and contemporary furniture exhibits as well as a planetarium, a botanical garden, and a Victorian-style house museum. The Grand Rapids Art Museum features local and regional artists. Several large sculptures are city landmarks, including La Grande Vitesse (1969), a monumental work by Alexander Calder, and the bronze American Horse, by American sculptor Nina Akamu, based on plans by Leonardo da Vinci. The Heritage Hill Historic District includes hundreds of historic residences, including the Meyer May House (1908), designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and the Voigt House (1895). The city’s public library contains one of the country’s most important collections of books on furniture design and manufacture.[P3]Educational institutions include Davenport University (1866), Calvin College (1876), Aquinas College (1886), Grand Rapids Community College (1914), and Kendall College of Art and Design (1928). Grand Valley State University (1960) is centred in nearby Allendale, and six of the university’s professional colleges—those of business, community and public services, education, engineering and computing, health professions, and nursing—are located in Grand Rapids proper. The city has some 30 parks, including a zoo.[P4]Grand Rapids was the boyhood home of U.S. Pres. Gerald R. Ford, who represented (1948–73) the congressional district that included the city. The Gerald R. Ford Museum (paired with the Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor), part of the federal presidential library system, is located in the city. Inc. village, 1838; city, 1850. Pop.

Laid out in 1859, it was named for John Hancock, the American Revolutionary leader. With the discovery of nearby copper mines in the mid-19th century, Hancock became a busy shipping point. The mines attracted many immigrants to the area, including large numbers of Finns. Local industries include the manufacture of plastic products and machined metal parts, lumber milling, and commercial fishing; tourism and outdoor recreation have been of increasing importance since copper production ended in the 1960s. Hancock is the seat of Finlandia University (Lutheran, 1896), which was founded (as Suomi College) by Finnish immigrants and for many years used Finnish as the language of instruction. The Arcadian Copper Mine and the Quincy Mine Steam Hoist have guided tours during the summer. The annual Heikinpäivä festival (January)—for St. Henrik of Uppsala, patron saint of Finland—celebrates the city’s Finnish heritage with skiing and sledding races, a parade, and traditional Finnish foods, crafts, and dancing.

Michigan"Interlochen"Village"Grand Traverse county"northwestern Michigan"Interlochen, unincorporated resort village, Grand Traverse county, northwestern Michigan, U.S., located in a fruit-growing region about 15 miles (25 km) south of Traverse City. The village (whose name means “between the lakes”) was named for its location between Lake Wahbekaness (Ottawa for “water lingers,” formerly Duck Lake) and Lake Wahbekanetta (“water lingers again,” formerly Green Lake).[P1]Interlochen is best known as the home of the Interlochen Arts Camp. Originally a summer music camp only, it has expanded to offer programs in dance and visual and theatre arts. The music camp began as the state-sponsored Camp Interlochen, for girls, in 1918; a camp for boys was established nearby in 1922. In 1928 these became the National High School Orchestra Camp and in 1931 the National Music Camp. The camp was not officially affiliated with the University of Michigan until 1942, though its first director was a music professor at Michigan. It allows student musicians at the elementary through high school levels to work closely with outstanding professional musicians. The dance, theatre, and visual arts programs offer similar experiences for students of those arts. During the months of June, July, and August, performances are given almost daily by camp participants and faculty, as well as by outside acts. The organization operates a public radio facility that broadcasts these performances and other arts programming. The Interlochen Arts Academy, founded in 1962, offers a full high school program—including music, dramatics, and related arts—throughout the school year. All these entities are under the umbrella organization Interlochen Center for the Arts. The arts camp is situated in a stately stand of virgin white pines, one of the last of the original forests in the region. Adjacent to the music camp is the 187-acre (76-hectare) Interlochen State Park.[P2] [END-OF-CONTENT]

It originated in the 1830s as a lumbering settlement and was named for the county, which is approximately in the middle of the state’s Lower Peninsula. Brine deposits formed the basis of the city’s chemical industry, which was the world’s largest producer of bromine by 1888. In 1890 industrialist Herbert H. Dow formed a company in Midland based on an improved method for bromine extraction he had developed, and the city expanded with the company’s growth. Dow Chemical Company (and later, Dow Corning) formed the basis of the city’s economy, producing a wide range of industrial, agricultural, and consumer chemicals and petrochemicals. The city is also noted for its imaginative architecture, including many public and private buildings designed by Alden B. Dow, Herbert’s son and a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. Dow’s home and studio is one of the city’s attractions, as are the Midland Center for the Arts, the Chippewa Nature Center, and the Dow Gardens.

In 1824 surveying crews for a proposed Detroit-Chicago highway placed the road’s Huron River crossing nearly 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Woodruff’s Grove, and the following year a trio of local landowners combined their holdings to create a new settlement at the crossing site. The settlement was named for Demetrios Ypsilantis, a patriot who fought in the War of Greek Independence; a monument to him stands in the city. Ypsilanti and Woodruff’s Grove coexisted for several years, but a fire at the Woodruff’s Grove school led to the abandonment of that settlement in favour of Ypsilanti. Ypsilanti developed as an outfitting point for travelers on the Detroit-Chicago road, which opened in 1835.

Bemidji was established in 1888. Its name, first applied to the lake and then to the Ojibwa chief who in 1883 became the area’s first permanent resident, is from an Ojibwa word meaning “a lake with crossing waters.” It was so named because the Mississippi River passes through the lake. Lumbering operations began in the late 19th century, and for several decades Bemidji was a major logging and sawmilling centre. As the largest city within a radius of nearly 100 miles (160 km), it is now an important retail, education, medical, and government centre. The surrounding scenic lake and forest region attracts a summer and winter resort trade. Tourism and the university are primary economic factors. Manufactures include wood products and electronics, and there is still some logging in the area. The city is the seat of Bemidji State University (founded 1919).

Minnesota"Duluth"City"seat of St"northeastern Minnesota"Duluth, city, seat of St. Louis county, northeastern Minnesota, U.S. One of Minnesota’s largest cities, it is a major inland port on the western tip of Lake Superior, at the mouth of the St. Louis River, opposite Superior, Wisconsin. Elevation is abrupt, rising 600 feet (180 metres) above the level of the lake in high rock bluffs, once the shoreline of glacial Lake Duluth. Along the crest a 30-mile (50-km) skyline boulevard commands an excellent view of both city and harbour. The combined Duluth-Superior harbour results from a natural breakwater formed by deposits left where river and lake meet. This resulting 9-mile (14-km) strip, Minnesota Point, or Park Point, extends toward Wisconsin Point, separating St. Louis and Allouez bays from Lake Superior. The narrow channel between the two points forms the Superior harbour entrance, and a dredged 300-foot (90-metre) ship canal across Minnesota Point, spanned by an aerial lift bridge, forms the Duluth harbour entrance. The combined harbour is the western terminus of the St. Lawrence Seaway, and, although icebound during the winter months, it is the largest port on the Great Lakes and one of the largest inland seaports in the world. Among the items shipped through it are iron ore from the Mesabi Range, coal from the western United States, and grain from the Red River valley and Canada. Harbour facilities include coal docks, grain elevators, and iron ore docks (which receive taconite from processing plants in northeastern Minnesota).[P1]DuluthDuluth, Minn.Randen Pederson[ML1]The area, occupied originally by the Sioux and the Ojibwa, was visited in the 17th century by French voyageurs, including Daniel Greysolon, sieur DuLhut (or Du Luth), who claimed the area for France in 1679 and for whom Duluth was named. The fur-trading post of Fond du Lac, on the St. Louis River, was active until the mid-19th century and was controlled successively by the Hudson’s Bay Company, the North West Company, and the American Fur Company. In 1852 the first settler, George P. Stuntz, arrived. Settlers in search of copper deposits arrived the following year, and Duluth was laid out in 1856. Railway extension into the northwestern wheat region, increased lake commerce following the cutting of the Duluth Ship Canal in 1871, lumbering, and development of the iron ranges brought increasing prosperity.[P2]Duluth is a regional health care, business, retail, education, financial, and cultural centre for northeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. In addition to shipping, economic assets include the railroads, an oil pipeline from Canada, a military air-defense installation at Duluth International Airport, aircraft maintenance facilities, government offices, the tourism industry, and paper milling, food processing, and printing and publishing enterprises. It is the site of a campus of the University of Minnesota (established in 1895, joined system in 1947) and the College of St. Scholastica (1912; affiliated with the Roman Catholic church), as well as a community college (1995).[P3]Duluth’s cultural activities include a symphony orchestra, ballet, and playhouse, as well as the Duluth Art Institute and the Tweed Museum of Art. The Lake Superior Railroad Museum and the Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center preserve the area’s railroading and shipping history. Great Lakes Aquarium is the only all-freshwater aquarium in the United States. Glensheen (1908) is a 22-acre (9-hectare) lakeside estate.

Ojibwa Indians were living in the area when fur trappers arrived in the 18th century. Settled in the 1880s as Florence, it was renamed for Samuel Ely, a Michigan miner. Iron ore was discovered there in 1883, but, because of the high cost of underground mining, the last underground mine closed in 1967. The logging industry has also declined (although some logging continues), and Ely’s economy now depends chiefly on tourism. Popular outdoor activities include canoeing, fishing, snowmobiling, dogsledding, hiking, and cross-country skiing. The International Wolf Center has a resident wolf pack and provides education about wolves. Ely lies in the heart of Superior National Forest and is the starting point for trips into the vast Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, which contains more than 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of water trails.

Following the discovery of iron ore in 1892 by early settler David T. Adams, the city was laid out and named for Erwin Eveleth, a Michigan lumberman who visited the area to scout the white pine forest. The original village was about 1 mile (1.6 km) southwest of the present location; ore was discovered underneath Eveleth in 1895, and in 1900 it was moved to its current site. Eveleth’s population increased dramatically between 1900 and 1910, with Scandinavian settlers arriving in large numbers. Higher-grade hematite ore reserves were eventually exhausted, and lower-grade taconite mining is now Eveleth’s chief industry. The Leonidas Overlook offers a panoramic view of extensive current mining operations such as the Thunderbird Mine and of former mines such as the Hull-Nelson (closed 1978). The overlook is a man-made hill constructed from mining debris, primarily from the Leonidas Mine (closed 1980), which, at 650 feet (200 metres), was once the deepest underground mine in the world.

Minnesota"Hibbing"City"Louis county"northeastern Minnesota"Hibbing, city, St. Louis county, northeastern Minnesota, U.S. It lies on the Mesabi Range, in a forest and lake region, about 70 miles (115 km) northwest of Duluth. Settled in 1892 when iron ore was discovered, it was laid out the following year and named for its founder, Frank Hibbing, a timber cruiser. When rich deposits of hematite iron ore were discovered under the streets, most of the community was moved 2 miles (3.2 km) south, beginning in 1919. Old Hibbing became an extension of the Hull Rust Mahoning Mine, the world’s largest open-pit iron-ore mine, 535 feet (163 metres) deep, more than 3 miles (5 km) long, and up to 2 miles (3.2 km) wide. The mine began shipping ore in 1895, and, although production diminished significantly, mining activities continued into the 21st century. The hematite was mostly exhausted by the 1950s, and Hibbing turned successfully to the processing of magnetic taconite. The city manufactures electronics and heavy-equipment parts and is a regional retail, transportation, and health care centre. Tourism also contributes to the local economy. The original Greyhound bus line was established at Hibbing by Carl Eric Wickman in 1914 as a commuter service between the old and new sites; a museum traces its development. The city is the site of Hibbing Community College (founded 1916). The Minnesota Museum of Mining and the Ironworld Discovery Center, both in nearby Chisholm, preserve the area’s mining history and ethnic heritage.

Part of the city extends across the Minnesota into Nicollet county. Mankato was founded in 1852 by Parsons Johnson and Henry Jackson. It was originally known as Mahkato, a name derived from a Sioux term for the blue clay along the riverbanks (Mankato was the result of an early spelling error, though the misspelling stuck). Flour milling and limestone quarrying were important to the city’s early growth. A Sioux uprising in 1862 culminated in a mass hanging at Mankato on December 26, when 38 Sioux were executed for having massacred white settlers (President Abraham Lincoln reduced the number from more than 300 sentenced to death); the execution spot is marked by a monument. The city lies in a rich agricultural region (primarily hogs, corn [maize], and soybeans) and has many farming-related industries, including soybean processing, feed preparation, and farm-equipment manufacturing. Health care, limestone quarrying, and a sizable printing industry (centred in North Mankato) contribute to the economy; manufactures include boat motors, electrical equipment, automotive bodies and parts, plastics, and generators.

Settlers had begun occupying U.S. military-reservation land on the west side of the river in 1849; in 1855 the government gave these illegal squatters patent rights, and the village of Minneapolis was incorporated in 1856. Its name was derived from the Sioux word minne, meaning “water,” and the Greek polis, for “city.” St. Anthony was chartered as a city in 1860 and Minneapolis in 1867; the two cities merged as Minneapolis in 1872.[P3]St. Anthony Falls, on the Mississippi River at the site of Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML3] The falls were an important factor in the city’s early economic growth as a lumber and flour-milling centre. By 1870 Minneapolis was the country’s top producer of flour. The lumber business reached its height in the late 19th century, when logs from the forests of the north jammed the river. As wheat growing in the northwest increased, flour milling superseded lumbering as the leading industry (the last lumber mill closed in 1919). Railroads, which multiplied connections with Chicago and the south and with the east through Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, were completed in the late 19th century. After World War I the availability of lower freight charges by means of Great Lakes shipping shifted much of the export flour trade to Buffalo, New York, though Minneapolis remained the headquarters for some large milling companies. In the second half of the 20th century, the city remained one of the nation’s primary wheat markets; the Minneapolis Grain Exchange was still one of the largest cash exchange markets in the world.[P4] The population of Minneapolis grew steadily from the late 19th to the mid-20th century, reaching a peak of 521,718 in 1950. The number of people subsequently began declining until about 1990, when the city population basically stabilized. At the same time, the population of the Twin Cities metropolitan area increased rapidly, fueled by the movement of thousands from city to suburbs. Throughout the city’s history the great majority of its residents have been of European (notably Scandinavian) ancestry, but that proportion has been decreasing, and the number of African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics has been growing; blacks now constitute roughly one-fifth of the population.[P5] Minneapolis garnered national and international attention on Aug. 1, 2007, when the Interstate 35W bridge over the Mississippi River collapsed unexpectedly during rush hour, causing 13 fatalities and nearly 150 injuries. A year later the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the bridge had collapsed because of a design flaw. The incident sparked nationwide concern for the safety of the country’s infrastructure.[P6]The Interstate 35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minn., collapsed on Aug. 1, 2007. © Michael Rubin/Shutterstock.com[ML6] [H3]The contemporary city Minneapolis is now a commercial, transportation, distribution, health care, financial, and industrial centre. Highly diversified manufactures include metal products, electronics, precision instruments, medical devices, plastics, machinery, computers and computer equipment, chemicals, automotive parts, and agricultural products. Publishing, milling, food processing, graphic arts, insurance, and high-technology industries are also important. The Twin Cities region is a rail and trucking centre and includes a major international airport in the southeastern corner of Minneapolis. The Skyway, a system of enclosed, climate-controlled pedestrian walkways located on the second-floor level, connects various points in the downtown area. A 12-mile (19-km) light-rail transit line, connecting downtown Minneapolis with the airport and the Mall of America in suburban Bloomington, opened in 2004.[P7]Skyline of Minneapolis, Minn.Donovan Reese/Getty Images[ML7] Minneapolis has the main portion of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (1851), campus; other institutions of higher education include Augsburg College (Lutheran; 1869), Dunwoody College of Technology (1914), Minneapolis College of Art and Design (1886), a campus of Metropolitan State University (1971), and North Central University (Pentecostal; 1930).

Minnesota"Moorhead"City"Clay county"western Minnesota"Moorhead, city, seat (1872) of Clay county, western Minnesota, U.S. It lies along the Red River of the North across from Fargo, North Dakota, in a mixed-farming area. Founded with the coming of the railroad in 1871, it was a natural transportation hub and river-crossing point, with overland road and rail traffic meeting the barges and, later, steamboats on the river. The city was named for William G. Moorhead, a director of the Northern Pacific Railway Company. Moorhead’s agriculture-based economy depends chiefly on sugar beet refining and the growing of crops such as sugar beets, wheat, barley, and potatoes. The service sector is also important. The city is the seat of Minnesota State University Moorhead (1885) and Concordia College (1891). Comstock House (1882), a restored home with its original furnishings, is a popular attraction. The city’s Scandinavian roots are celebrated through the Hjemkomst Center, which contains a replica Viking ship and a replica stave church, and an annual festival in June.

Minnesota"New Ulm"City"Brown county"south-central Minnesota"New Ulm, city, seat of Brown county, south-central Minnesota, U.S., on the Minnesota River, near the mouth of the Cottonwood River, about 90 miles (145 km) southwest of Minneapolis. Founded in 1854 by German immigrants of the Chicago Land Society, led by Frederick Beinhorn, it was named for Ulm in Württemberg. They were joined two years later by a group of German immigrants from Cincinnati led by Wilhelm Pfaender. The town was almost destroyed in the Sioux uprising of 1862; the Defenders’ Monument next to the courthouse square commemorates the event. Overlooking the city on a bluff is a 102-foot (31-metre) monument (1897) honouring Arminius (Hermann), a German tribal leader who inflicted a major defeat on the Romans at the Teutoburg Forest in 9 ce. New Ulm’s economy is based on agriculture (livestock, corn [maize], soybeans, peas, and dairying), food processing, and light manufacturing (chiefly electronic equipment, gaskets, and motors). The city is home to Martin Luther College, formed in 1995 by the amalgamation of Dr. Martin Luther College (1884) and Northwestern College (1865). Several festivals celebrate the city’s German heritage, and there is a 45-foot (14-metre) glockenspiel (1979) in Schonlau Park.

Founded in 1855 by New England lawyer John W. North, it became the home of Carleton (1866) and St. Olaf (1874) colleges. Flour milling was the basic industry until the 1880s; later, dairy farming became a primary economic factor, and Northfield specialized in Holstein cows. Modern agriculture includes dairying and the production of hogs, turkeys, corn (maize), and soybeans. Food processing is a major industry, and manufactures include electronics, glass, and food-storage machinery.

Founded in 1854, the city soon became a stopping place for several stagecoach and, later, railroad lines and a milling centre using the river’s waterpower. According to legend, the Straight River had curative powers and was able to restore the daughter of an Indian chief to health; a statue of the princess dating from the 1930s stands in Mineral Springs Park, which was the site of an 1870s planned health resort. Owatonna was also the site of Minnesota’s only state orphanage (1886–1945); the orphanage’s complex now houses a museum, an arts centre, and a sculpture garden. The innovative American architect Louis Sullivan designed Owatonna’s National Farmers’ Bank Building (1908). Formerly a major producer of butter, Owatonna still has dairying interests and also produces livestock, corn (maize), soybeans, and peas. Manufactures include glass, tools, electronics, hardware, music equipment, exercise equipment, and heavy machinery; insurance and food processing are also important.

Minnesota"Pipestone"City"Pipestone county"southwestern Minnesota"Pipestone, city, seat of Pipestone county, southwestern Minnesota, U.S. It lies on the Coteau des Prairies, near the South Dakota state line, about 40 miles (65 km) northeast of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Settlers were attracted to the Pipestone area by Native American legends of a quarry where red stone for ceremonial pipes was found. From about 1200 ce several Plains tribes, particularly the Sioux, quarried stone there (rock drawings in the area date from about 2000 bce). Artist and author George Catlin visited the site in 1836 and recorded it in both painting and writing. Settlement began in 1873 when Iowa druggist Charles Bennett arrived, and the city was laid out in 1876. It grew as a trade centre with the arrival of the railroad (1879), the production of building blocks made from the area’s quartzite deposits, and farming on the fertile prairie soil. Agriculture (including sheep, hogs and pigs, soybeans, and corn [maize]) is a mainstay of the economy, and meatpacking, the manufacture of boats, and tourism are also important. The city is home to a community and technical college campus. Pipestone National Monument is immediately northwest, and Split Rock Creek State Park is southwest. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow popularized the quarries in The Song of Hiawatha (1855); the city has a Hiawatha Club that stages an annual theatrical pageant. Inc. village, 1881; city, 1901. Pop.

In 1805 the explorer Zebulon Pike arrived at the site, which was overlooked by Barn Bluff and was then a Sioux village. Pike held a meeting with an Indian chief named Hupahuduta (“Wing of the Wild Swan Dyed Red”), for whom the community was later named. A Swiss Protestant missionary post was established (1837–46). A permanent settlement of farmers and traders was made about 1850. By 1873 a primary wheat market had developed, but this industry later declined. The Red Wing Potteries, founded in 1878, contributed greatly to the city’s economy until the factory closed in 1967. Today casino gambling, printing, leather tanning, and the manufacture of footwear, safety equipment, and industrial parts are important to the economy. Agriculture includes dairying, corn (maize), soybeans, peas, oats, and livestock. Frontenac State Park is southeast of the city on Lake Pepin.

The site, which originally served as a camping ground for wagon trains and later as a stagecoach and rail centre, was settled in 1854 and named for Rochester, New York, by George Head, an early settler who had lived there for a time. Rochester’s growth was stimulated in 1889 by the opening by William Worrall Mayo and his sons (see Mayo family) of what would evolve into the Mayo Medical Center, and it is now one of the state’s largest cities. Severe flooding in 1978 prompted a flood-control project that continued into the 1990s.[P1]RochesterThe Zumbro River winding through Rochester, Minn.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers[ML1]Rochester’s economy is based on health care, high-technology industries, and agriculture. The famed Mayo Clinic, which is actually a combination of hospitals, clinics, and research and education facilities, is by far the largest employer. Primary agricultural products are corn (maize), soybeans, peas, livestock, and dairy products; food processing is also important. Manufactures include computers and computer equipment, automotive parts, and electrical equipment. Minnesota Bible College (1913), now called Crossroads College, moved to Rochester from Minneapolis in 1971. A branch of the University of Minnesota was officially established in Rochester in 2006.

It extends eastward across the Mississippi to include parts of Benton and Sherburne counties. First settled in 1851, it was laid out in 1854 and named for the French city of Saint-Cloud. During the Sioux uprising of 1862, the settlement reportedly served as a refuge for fleeing homesteaders. It is the seat of St. Cloud State University (1869) and a state prison (1889). Nearby are St. John’s University (1857) at Collegeville and the College of St. Benedict (1913) at St. Joseph. St. Cloud is known for its granite quarries, which have been worked since 1868. It is located in the state’s top agricultural region, which produces dairy products, poultry, oats, barley, rye, hay, corn, and soybeans. Manufactures include freezers, wood products, buses, packaging, storage tanks, concrete, paper, machinery, outdoor products, and photo albums.

Situated in the southeastern part of the state, St. Paul is at the head of navigation on the Mississippi River near its confluence with the Minnesota River. The city adjoins Minneapolis on the west, and together they form the Twin Cities metropolitan area, the largest conurbation in the state and in the U.S. north-central region. Suburban communities include Roseville (north), Maplewood (north and east), Woodbury (east), Cottage Grove (southeast), and South St. Paul and Eagan (south).[P1]Downtown St. Paul, Minnesota.© Comstock Images/JupiterimagesSaint Paul, Minn.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML1]St. Paul, the state’s second most populous city (behind Minneapolis), lies along a deep S-shaped bend of the Mississippi and is built on a series of bluffs rising from the river to the surrounding plains. Eight lakes are located wholly or partially within the municipal boundaries, and the city maintains more than 160 parks. The climate is cool temperate, with long, cold winters and warm summers. High river levels in spring have caused damaging floods on occasion, as in 1965 and 1993, but control measures have been undertaken to reduce the problem. Inc. village, 1849; city, 1854.

In 1680 the Franciscan missionary Louis Hennepin passed the site, and in 1766 explorer Jonathan Carver probed a nearby cavern (since known as Carver’s Cave). In 1805 Lieutenant Zebulon Montgomery Pike, leader of an American expedition to explore the headwaters of the Mississippi River, made a treaty there (never officially ratified) with the Sioux for possession of the region, including the site on which the military outpost Fort Snelling (now a state park) was later built. The first land claim was made in 1838 by tavern owner Pierre (“Pig’s Eye”) Parrant; he was closely followed by Abraham Perry. The settlement was known as Pig’s Eye Landing until 1841, when Roman Catholic missionary Lucien Galtier built a log chapel dedicated to the apostle Paul. In 1849 St. Paul became the capital of the newly formed Minnesota Territory, and it was made the state capital when Minnesota was admitted to the Union in 1858.[P3] St. Paul’s historic importance in the development of the Upper Midwest was as a commercial centre that utilized its strategic location on the Mississippi. Furs were its first products for the outside market. In 1862 the first train left the city on the 10-mile (16-km) track of the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. In 1883 a great celebration marked the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway from St. Paul to the West Coast, and 10 years later the Great Northern Railway, under the leadership of James J. Hill, was completed, with St. Paul as the eastern terminus (both railways are now part of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation). These railroad developments made the city the gateway to the Pacific Northwest and spurred its growth. In 1886 the St. Paul Union Stockyards were established, and the livestock market (later moved to suburban South St. Paul) became one of the world’s largest. Meatpacking plants also flourished in the city, but during the 1970s the market dramatically declined in size, and most major packing plants closed.[P4]St. Paul, Minnesota, illustration by George H. Ellsbury from Alfred Theodore Andreas's An Illustrated Historical Atlas of the State of Minnesota, 1874.The Newberry Library[ML4] In the 1920s and ’30s, St. Paul became known as a safe haven for gangsters from other Midwestern cities; some of the locales formerly associated with them have become tourist attractions. Economic difficulties and migration to the suburbs contributed to a decline in the central city in the mid-20th century, but, beginning in the mid-1970s, the city undertook large-scale urban-renewal projects, redeveloping downtown business and residential areas.[P5] St. Paul’s population grew steadily during the first half of the 20th century, nearly doubling between 1900 and the peak year of 1960 (when it reached 313,411). The number of people subsequently declined, as had happened in Minneapolis, though in St. Paul the drop was not nearly as sharp as it was for its western neighbour. By about 1990 the city’s population was again increasing. Throughout the city’s history the great majority of its residents have been of European (largely German and Irish) ancestry, but that proportion has been decreasing as the number of African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics has grown; the latter three groups now constitute about one-third of the population.[P6] [H3]The contemporary city St. Paul is a major education, health care, government, financial, and industrial centre. Highly diversified manufactures include automobiles, chemicals, computer products and software, tools, machinery, and medical equipment. Insurance, high-technology industries, food processing, oil refining, and convention business are also important. The city is corporate headquarters of 3M (Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Company). The Twin Cities region is a rail and trucking centre and includes a major international airport on the southwestern corner of St. Paul. The Skyway, a system of enclosed, climate-controlled pedestrian walkways located at the second-floor level, connects various points in the downtown area.[P7] St. Paul is the home of some dozen institutions of higher education, including the main campus of the College of St. Catherine (Roman Catholic; 1905), the University of St. Thomas (Roman Catholic; 1885), Hamline University (Methodist; 1854), Macalester College (1874), Bethel University (Baptist; 1871), Luther Seminary (Lutheran; 1869), Concordia University (Lutheran; 1893), a campus of Metropolitan State University (1971), and a part of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (1851), campus.

The St. Paul Union Stockyards opened in 1886, bringing large numbers of primarily central and eastern European immigrants to the city to work in the yards and associated meatpacking plants. By the 1970s, however, most of the large plants had closed, and the stockyard decreased dramatically in size. Efforts at redevelopment soon followed, and during the 1990s the former site of a major plant was turned into an industrial park.

Sioux and Ojibwa Indians were early inhabitants of the area, which was originally part of Wisconsin Territory. One of Minnesota’s oldest communities, it was first settled by trader Joseph Renshaw Brown in 1839 and called Dakotah. The city was officially founded in 1843 with the incorporation of the Stillwater Lumber Company and was renamed for the stillness of the lake’s water. It was laid out in 1848 and was the site of the convention (August 26, 1848) that led to the formation of Minnesota Territory in 1849. More mills were built in the 1850s, and Stillwater became a lumbering centre as logs were floated down the St. Croix from northern forests. The industry ended in the early 20th century, with the last logs passing through in 1914. Tourism is now a major focus of the economy, and the city has many historic buildings (including a courthouse dating from 1870). Manufactures include plastic molds, automotive parts, windows, and medical supplies, and agriculture includes corn (maize), soybeans, and nursery crops. There are two state prisons in the city.

Iron ore was discovered in 1890 by Leonidas Merritt at the site of the nearby city of Mountain Iron. Two years later ore was found at the site of Virginia, which was then laid out as a mining centre and named for the home state of an area lumberman. The city burned down in both 1893 and 1900 and was subsequently rebuilt. Lumbering soon became a major industry as well, with Virginia being the site of the world’s largest white-pine mill from 1909 to 1929. In the early 1980s the mining industry suffered economic setbacks, but it remains the basis of the city’s economy. Although hematite iron-ore reserves diminished, taconite is now mined. Virginia is also the area’s retail hub, and tourism contributes to the local economy. The city is home to a community and technical college campus. A popular event is the Land of the Loon Ethnic Arts and Crafts Festival, which is held every June. The Mineview in the Sky Overlook offers views of the area’s deepest open-pit mine.

Settlers began arriving in the area in 1856, but the community was later deserted because of the Sioux uprising of 1862. In 1869 the railroad reached the spot, and the town was laid out and named for Leon Willmar, an agent of the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company. It became a railroad division headquarters and a shipping point for the surrounding agricultural region. Swedish and Norwegian immigrants settled in the area. Agriculture remains the basis of the city’s economy. Turkey processing is the major industry; the county is Minnesota’s top producer of turkeys. Other farm products include corn (maize), soybeans, sugar beets, and dairy products. Tourism and the manufacture of farm equipment are also important. Willmar is a regional health care, education, government, and trade centre.

Minnesota"Winona"City"Winona county"southeastern Minnesota"Winona, city, seat of Winona county, southeastern Minnesota, U.S. It lies in the Hiawatha Valley on the Mississippi River (bridged to Wisconsin), backed by high bluffs, in a mixed-farming area, about 45 miles (70 km) east of Rochester. Franciscan missionary Louis Hennepin visited the area about 1680; other missionaries and fur traders followed. The city—founded in 1851 by steamboat captain Orrin Smith—was called Montezuma when laid out in 1852 but was renamed to honour a legendary Sioux princess, who legend says jumped to her death from the bluffs after having been denied the right to marry a man she loved. Large numbers of Polish and German immigrants settled there. The city served as a supply point for westbound settlers, and its early growth as a river port and wheat-shipping, lumbering, and flour-milling centre was boosted by the construction of the railroad in 1862. After 1900 timber and wheat operations declined, and diversified industries arose.[P1]Winona is a major dairy-producing centre; other agricultural products include corn (maize), soybeans, and oats. The city’s diversified manufactures include electronics, composite materials, automotive parts, industrial and construction equipment, hardware, chain, lighting fixtures, canoes, home- and personal-care products, promotional products, packaging, stained glass, apparel, and candy. Music publishing and tourism are important to the economy, and limestone quarrying is carried out. The city is the seat of Winona State University (1858) and St. Mary’s University of Minnesota (1912). Sugar Loaf Mountain, a limestone formation 85 feet (25 metres) high, perched atop a 500-foot (150-metre) bluff above Lake Winona, was a river pilot’s landmark. Garvin Heights Park, situated on a 575-foot (175-metre) bluff, allows views for miles up and down the river. The city has a large historical museum and a Polish cultural institute. John A. Latsch, Great River Bluffs, and Whitewater state parks are nearby. Winona is the headquarters of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge. Inc. 1857. Pop.

Mississippi"Bay Saint Louis"City"Hancock county"southern Mississippi"Bay Saint Louis, city, seat (1860) of Hancock county, southern Mississippi, U.S. It lies along Mississippi Sound (an embayment of the Gulf of Mexico) at the entrance to St. Louis Bay, 58 miles (93 km) northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana.[P1]The site was part of a 1789 Spanish land grant to Thomas Shields. The village soon became a resort for wealthy planters and, later, for tourists who arrived after the New Orleans, Mobile and Chattanooga Railroad was completed in 1869. The town was incorporated as Shieldsborough in 1818 and as the city of Bay Saint Louis in 1882. During the War of 1812, the bay (named in 1699 for Louis IX of France) was the scene (1814) of the naval engagement against the British known as the Battle of Pass Christian. In the late 20th century, casino gambling fueled the growth of the city, significantly increasing tourism’s importance to the local economy. Bay Saint Louis, along with most of Hancock county, sustained severe storm damage in 2005 from Hurricane Katrina; the neighbouring city of Waveland was virtually razed. The John C. Stennis Space Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is about 15 miles (24 km) west. Buccaneer State Park is to the south near Waveland. Pop.

The settlement there, at Fort Maurepas, was the first capital (1699–1702) of the Louisiana Territory. Fort Louis, the site of present-day Biloxi, was the territorial capital circa 1719–22. Since its founding, Biloxi has been under the flags of France, Spain, Great Britain, the West Florida Republic, the Confederacy, and the United States. During the American Civil War, it submitted to Union forces from Fort Massachusetts on Ship Island (12 miles [19 km] offshore and now part of Gulf Islands National Seashore). The city is named for the Biloxi, a Native American people who once inhabited the area; the name is thought to mean “first people.” Biloxi, on the Gulf Coast, is subject to periodic devastating hurricanes (tropical cyclones), including Hurricane Camille in 1969 and the even more destructive Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[P2]Beginning in the 1990s, casino gambling became one of Biloxi’s chief economic activities, with several casinos located in the city. Government services and seafood processing are also important. Annual festivals include the blessing of the shrimp fleet and the Biloxi Mardi Gras. Beauvoir, the home of former Confederate president Jefferson Davis for the last 12 years of his life, is 5 miles (8 km) west; it was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Settled as a trading post (1817), it was known until 1821 as Possum Town. In 1822 or 1823 the Cotton Plant first docked in Columbus, having become the first steamboat to navigate the Upper Tombigbee River. During the American Civil War the Confederates maintained a large arsenal in the town, which served as a temporary state capital when the city of Jackson fell to Union forces in 1863. Columbus is one of a number of places that claim to have originated the observance of Memorial Day, having first celebrated it (then known as Decoration Day) at Friendship Cemetery on April 25, 1866, with the honouring of both Confederate and Union dead. Many antebellum homes survive in Columbus and can be visited during the annual spring pilgrimage.[P1]Columbus: ShadowlawnShadowlawn, an antebellum home in Columbus, Mississippi.Jeffrey Reed[ML1]Columbus is an important trade centre for the surrounding agricultural region.

Old Greenville, named for the American Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene, was sited just to the south; part of this original settlement caved into the Mississippi River, and the remainder was burned by Union troops during the American Civil War. The present city was established on the Blantonia Plantation during the Reconstruction period. After a disastrous flood in 1927, higher levees were built. Lake Ferguson was created in the 1930s when an S-shaped curve in the Mississippi River was straightened.[P1]Greenville is in the Mississippi Delta region of the state, noted for its blues musicians and fertile soils. Agriculture (particularly cotton and catfish) remains important to the city’s economy, with tourism also a major factor (including gambling casinos). Greenville is the state’s largest river port, and manufacturing (chemicals and clothing) is also important.

The original settlement (1834), known as Williams Landing, was incorporated (1844) and named for the Choctaw chieftain Greenwood Leflore, a wealthy cotton planter. The town thrived as a shipping point for cotton on its way down the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans, but its trade was paralyzed during the American Civil War. Greenwood was used as a Confederate defensive post during the Union’s siege of Vicksburg in 1863, and Fort Pemberton, built between the Tallahatchie and Yazoo rivers, withstood a Union gunboat attack.[P1]The city’s extensive cotton market is supplemented by other agriculture (including catfish farming) and some light manufacturing (including pianos and picture frames).

Gulfport is a port of entry on Mississippi Sound, an embayment of the Gulf of Mexico.[P1]It was founded in 1887 by Captain William H. Hardy as the site for the terminus of his Gulf and Ship Island Railroad. In 1902 Captain Joseph T. Jones assumed control of the line, and he and his family helped develop the city and harbour. In the 1920s Gulfport experienced a short-lived boom as a seaside resort after the Gulf line was bought by the Illinois Central Railroad. Following World War II, its resort-hotel business grew rapidly, enhanced by one of the world’s longest man-made sand beaches (extending eastward for 26 miles [42 km] from Pass Christian through Gulfport to Biloxi). In 1969 Hurricane Camille devastated Gulfport’s beachfront and port, but the area was subsequently rebuilt. The city again suffered extensive storm damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005.[P2]The surrounding coastal bayous and rivers abound with fish. Gulfport’s deepwater harbour is notable for handling banana imports. Tourism is a major part of the economy, spurred by the addition of casino gambling in the 1990s; shipbuilding is also important.

Jackson is also the coseat (with nearby Raymond) of Hinds county. Settled (1792) by Louis LeFleur, a French-Canadian trader, and known as LeFleur’s Bluff, it remained a trading post until the Treaty of Doak’s Stand (October 18, 1820) opened the territory to white settlement. Selected as the site for the state capital and named for Andrew Jackson, it was laid out (April 1822) using Thomas Jefferson’s checkerboard plan with alternate squares designated as parks. The state legislature first met there December 23, 1822. The first railroad arrived by 1840.[P1]New Capitol, Jackson, Mississippi.Joel Brown/Shostal Associates[ML1]During the Vicksburg campaigns of the American Civil War the city was occupied twice by Union troops; when it was reduced to ashes (July 1863) by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman’s forces, it became known as “Chimneyville.” After the Civil War, Jackson was troubled by a corrupt city government run by carpetbaggers, and its recovery was slow until the arrival of new railroads in the 1880s. The Old Capitol (1840)—scene of the state secession vote (1861) and Constitutional Convention (1890), and restored as a historical museum—was replaced by the New Capitol (1903) in gray stone. The Governor’s Mansion (1842) served as headquarters for Sherman.[P2]The discovery of nearby natural gas fields in the 1930s supplied cheaper fuel and stimulated industrial growth. Jackson is a major distribution and transportation centre. Telecommunications and government services are major components of the economy; poultry processing and the manufacture of automotive parts are also important.

It passed from France to England (1763) at the conclusion of the French and Indian War and was a haven for loyalists during the American Revolution. In 1779 it was captured by a Spanish expedition under Bernardo de Gálvez and remained under Spanish dominion until 1798 when the United States took possession and made it the first capital (1798–1802) of the Mississippi Territory. During the ensuing years it burgeoned as the commercial and cultural centre of a vast and rich cotton-producing area. It was the southern terminus of the Natchez Trace (an overland trail from Nashville, Tennessee; now the Natchez Trace Parkway) and an important river port. During the American Civil War it was bombarded by a Union gunboat and was occupied in July 1863.[P1]D'Evereux mansion, one of many antebellum homes in Natchez, Miss.Arthur Griffin/Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML1]Natchez recovered from its post-Civil War decline to become one of the state’s leading industrial centres. The production of wood pulp, lumber, petroleum, and natural gas form the basis of the economy; tourism (including casino gambling) and the manufacture of tires are also important. It retains many features of the antebellum South and is noted for its annual spring and fall pilgrimages, during which several antebellum homes are open to the public, and performances and historical pageants are held. An inn, built about 1798 and restored as the House on Ellicott’s Hill, was the gathering place for adventurers who sailed the river or traveled the Natchez Trace. Shops and restaurants now occupy the site of Natchez Under-the-Hill, a 19th-century town of bordellos and taverns that was a haven for outlaws and boatmen.

It was a fishing village until the 1880s, when it became a popular Gulf Coast resort for cotton planters. In 2005 Hurricane Katrina destroyed portions of the city.[P1]Gulf Islands National Seashore is headquartered in Ocean Springs. The huge Ruskin Oak, thought to be some 500 years old, was named for John Ruskin, the English writer and artist, who is said to have visited the spot in 1885. The Walter Anderson Museum of Art contains a large collection of works by that 20th-century American painter. The city also has a replica of Fort Maurepas, and a festival commemorating d’Iberville’s arrival is held annually in April. A Mardi Gras parade is held each year. Inc. town, 1892; city, 1947. Pop.

Mississippi"Oxford"City"Lafayette county"northern Mississippi"Oxford, city, seat (1837) of Lafayette county, northern Mississippi, U.S. It is situated about 75 miles (120 km) southeast of Memphis, Tennessee. Originating as a trading post, it was incorporated in 1837 and named for the English centre of learning, reflecting the townspeople’s early desire for a university. The University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), chartered 1844, was opened there in 1848. During the American Civil War, the university served as a hospital, and the city was briefly occupied by Union forces in late 1862 and again in August 1864, when it was burned. In the fall of 1962 Oxford was torn by rioting over the enrollment of an African American student, James H. Meredith, at the University of Mississippi during the desegregation of the state educational system. The novelist William Faulkner, who was born in New Albany, 35 miles (56 km) northeast, lived in Oxford. Rowan Oak, his home from 1930 until his death in 1962, where he wrote his tales of Jefferson (Oxford) and Yoknapatawpha (Lafayette) county, is on Old Taylor Road.

The Gulf Coast settlement developed around a structure called the Old Spanish Fort (which was neither Spanish nor a fort) built in 1718 by the Frenchman Joseph Simon de la Pointe. It thrived in the 19th century as a lumber-shipping port. The Pascagoula River is known locally as the Singing River because of strange humming sounds audible in its vicinity. The city’s name is derived from Pasca Okla (“Bread People”), the Choctaw name for a small band of Native Americans who once lived in the area.[P1]A seaport and a fishing and shipbuilding centre, Pascagoula also has a diversified industrial base that produces paper products, petroleum, and chemicals. The Old Spanish Fort Museum includes the original 1718 building. Shepard State Park is nearby, and Gulf Islands National Seashore is off the coast. A Mardi Gras parade is held annually. A naval station is located in the city. In 2005 Hurricane Katrina caused widespread devastation in the city. Inc. village, 1892; city, 1901. Pop.

It is named for the nearby deepwater channel known as Christian’s Pass, which runs through the sound along the Gulf Coast, supposedly navigated in 1699 by Christian L’Adnier, a member of the crew of the French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville. Originally settled by the French and Spanish, it became a trading centre with the opening of the Mississippi Territory. A U.S. garrison was stationed there in 1811, and the misnamed Battle of Pass Christian, fought (1814) during the War of 1812 nearby in St. Louis Bay, was the last naval engagement (a British victory) to take place in continental U.S. waters against a foreign foe.[P1]The first yacht club on the Gulf Coast was organized at Pass Christian in 1849, and the town became a popular resort for plantation owners. Later the railroads brought an influx of winter visitors from the North, including Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Harry S. Truman. The city was devastated by Hurricane Camille in 1969 but subsequently recovered. It was again destroyed in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina, which displaced all its residents.[P2]A sand beach 26 miles (42 km) long extends eastward from Pass Christian through Gulfport to Biloxi.

It was settled about 1840 by Tennesseean John Cox, who named it for his friend the Reverend Harris Joplin, a Methodist missionary who was also an early settler. The discovery of lead and zinc ores in the area in the mid-1800s brought prosperity, and in 1873 Joplin merged with Murphysburg. When the mining boom collapsed in the 1930s, other industries were developed.[P1]Residents in Joplin, Missouri, surveying the destruction caused by a tornado, May 2011.Mike Gullett/AP[ML1]Now a shipping and trade centre for the area’s farm products, Joplin also has diversified manufactures, including chemicals, precision bearings, truck bodies, and asphalt roofing products.

Missouri was the name of a group of indigenous people who lived in the area at the time… READ MORE History French fur traders, led by François Chouteau, traveled up the Missouri River from St. Louis and were the first permanent settlers in the area (1821). Westport was laid out a few miles south of the trading post by John Calvin McCoy in 1833, and it flourished as an outfitting post for western overland expeditions. Nearby to the east, another major departure point for westbound settlers, Independence was the main river port for supplies, which were then taken overland to Westport. McCoy found an easier landing spot on the bank of the Missouri that was several miles closer to Westport, and soon riverboats began unloading there. Westport prospered as a terminus for the Santa Fe, California, and Oregon trails. It was chartered as the town of Kansas (named for the Kansa Indians) in 1850 and as a city in 1853. It became Kansas City under an 1889 charter in order to distinguish it from the territory.[P2] Prior to and during the American Civil War, the city was sharply divided (because of its location on the border between Missouri, a slave state, and Kansas, a free state) and was the target of several skirmishes, including raids by the Confederate guerrilla William C. Quantrill. It was the site of a decisive battle on October 23, 1864, in which a Confederate army led by General Sterling Price was forced to retreat by a Union army commanded by General Samuel Curtis; it was the war’s last major battle west of the Mississippi River. Rapid growth followed after Kansas City was reached (1865) by a railroad from St. Louis and linked (1869) with the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad by bridge across the Missouri River. A stockyard was opened in 1870, and Kansas City became a major cattle market and a centre of the meatpacking industry.[P3] Economic and population growth continued in the early 20th century, an era dominated by the political boss Thomas J. Pendergast. Both world wars also provided major boosts to the city’s economy. The Kansas City style of jazz music emerged during the 1920s and ’30s, made famous through artists such as saxophonist Lester Young and pianist-bandleader Count Basie. Kansas City grew even more quickly after World War II, as it annexed adjacent land and increased its area more than fivefold. City population peaked in 1970—when it surpassed a half million—and then slowly declined until stabilizing in the 1990s. The proportion of African Americans steadily grew, reaching nearly one-third of Kansas City’s residents by 2000.[P4]Map of Kansas City, Missouri, U.S. (c. 1900), from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML4] [H3]The contemporary city Kansas City’s long-important livestock-handling and meatpacking activities have disappeared, but the city remains the marketing and shipping centre for a vast agricultural region (including soybeans, corn [maize], dairy products, and wheat) and has extensive grain-storage and food-processing facilities. A major distribution centre, the city is one of the largest rail hubs in the country and an important trucking centre. It has an international airport and port facilities on the Missouri River. Services (including government, health care, telecommunications, and finance) constitute the largest share of the city’s economy. Manufacturing (notably automobiles, greeting cards, weapons components, and pharmaceuticals), tourism (including riverboat casino gambling), and research and development of agricultural products are also important. A unique feature of the city is a vast underground industrial park known as SubTropolis, developed in the space created as the area was mined for its limestone deposits. The complex has streets and buildings and provides warehousing, storage, and office space. Nearby Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (Independence, Missouri) and Fort Leavenworth (Leavenworth, Kansas) are additional economic assets.[P5] The University of Missouri at Kansas City opened in 1933; other institutions of higher education include Rockhurst University (1910), Avila University (1916), several Metropolitan Community College campuses, William Jewell College (1849; in Liberty), Park University (1875; in Parkville), the University of Health Sciences College of Osteopathic Medicine (1916), and the Kansas City Art Institute (1885). Kansas City is the world headquarters for the Church of the Nazarene, the Unity School of Christianity, and People to People International.[P6] The American Royal, held each fall in the city, includes livestock and horse shows and a rodeo. The Liberty Memorial is a World War I monument that includes a 217-foot (66-metre) tower and a museum; the tower, dedicated in 1926, underwent a three-year restoration completed in 2002.

For the eastern United States, Missouri had a reputation as the chief gateway to points west. READ MORE History The area was originally inhabited by mound builders of the Mississippian culture. The French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet passed by during their exploration of the Mississippi in 1673. In 1764 Pierre Laclède Liguest of New Orleans founded a fur-trading post on the site, which at the time was located in Spanish territory. It was laid out by Auguste Chouteau and named for the canonized king Louis IX of France. St. Louis was later retroceded (1800) to France and, following the Louisiana Purchase (1803), became part of the United States. In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition departed from St. Louis on its great exploratory journey to the Pacific Northwest. The city was the seat of government for the Louisiana (1805) and Missouri (1812) territories.[P2] With the arrival of steamboats in 1817, St. Louis began to grow rapidly and became an important river port. German and Irish immigrants settled there in the 19th century. It was the site of the Missouri constitutional convention (1820), but it ceased to serve as capital when statehood was attained (1821). It became the crossroads of westward expansion in the United States and an outfitting point for exploring parties, fur-trading expeditions, and pioneers traveling across the state to Independence and the start of the Santa Fe, California, and Oregon trails. In 1849 a cholera epidemic killed thousands, and a section of the city was destroyed by fire when a steamboat exploded on the riverfront. Railroads arrived in the 1850s, and by the 1870s they had mostly replaced the steamboats as the dominant means of transportation. During the American Civil War, St. Louis was kept under martial law while remaining a Union base.[P3] The fur trade remained important until the mid-1800s, but during the latter half of the 19th century St. Louis developed as an industrial centre for brewing and manufacturing (including clothes, shoes, and iron). The Eads Bridge (1874; now a national historic landmark) connected the railroads across the Mississippi, and the city continued to be a major transportation hub. In 1904 the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (also known as the St. Louis World’s Fair) was held just west of the city in Forest Park to commemorate the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase. This event, in conjunction with the 1904 Olympic Games in the city, brought it international attention. Financial backing from St. Louis businessmen sponsored Charles A. Lindbergh’s historic 1927 nonstop solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean in the Spirit of St. Louis.[P4]A crowded street at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML4] St. Louis’s population increased steadily during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Growth stagnated somewhat in the Great Depression of the 1930s but boomed again during World War II, and the population reached a peak of more than 850,000 in 1950. During that period, African Americans were a growing proportion of the newcomers. The city’s population subsequently declined rapidly. By 2000 it was only about two-fifths of its 1950 level, roughly comparable to what it had been in 1880. Most of those leaving the city were people of European ancestry who poured into the surrounding suburbs; those communities, in turn, quickly grew in size. The number of African Americans in St. Louis also dropped, but at a much slower rate, and by 2000 blacks constituted more than half of the city’s residents.[P5]Map of St. Louis, Missouri, U.S. (c. 1900), from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML5] [H3]The contemporary city St. Louis remains a major transportation and distribution centre. The city is the second largest inland port in the country and is a major part of the Inland Waterway System. It is the northernmost point on the Mississippi that remains ice-free all year; major cargoes include grain, coal, petroleum products, and chemicals. St. Louis is also one of the country’s largest rail centres and has an international airport and an extensive network of interstate highways. The city is the headquarters for several major corporations. Services, including health care, finance and banking, telecommunications, airline operations, and education, are major contributors to the economy. Manufacturing is still a primary factor, and products include beer, chemicals, metal products, missiles, military aircraft, and automobiles. High-technology industries are also important, and an air force base is nearby in Illinois.[P6] Several institutions of higher education are in the metropolitan area. St. Louis University (1818) maintains the Pius XII Memorial Library, which preserves microfilm of Vatican Library treasures. Washington University (1853) was founded by William Greenleaf Eliot, grandfather of the poet T.S. Eliot, and St. Louis College of Pharmacy dates from 1864. The University of Missouri–St. Louis (1963) is just northwest of the city. Other schools include Lindenwood University in St. Charles (1827), Harris-Stowe State College (1857), Maryville University of St. Louis (1872), Webster University (1915), Fontbonne University (1923), and St. Louis Community College (1962).[P7] The Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra (1880) is one of the oldest in the United States; the city also has an opera company and several theatre organizations. Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, built on the original village plat, is dominated by the 630-foot (192-metre) stainless-steel Gateway Arch (1965), designed by architect Eero Saarinen to commemorate St. Louis’s historic role as “Gateway to the West.” The site includes the Museum of Westward Expansion; the Old Cathedral (Basilica of St. Louis, King; 1831–34), which was granted a special indulgence by Pope Gregory XVI; and the Old Courthouse (1839–62; now a museum), which was the scene of two early trials in the Dred Scott slavery case (1847 and 1850) and contains murals by Carl Wimar. In Aloe Plaza stands Swedish sculptor Carl Milles’s fountain symbolizing the convergence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. The boyhood home of poet Eugene Field is now a toy museum. Forest Park is the site of several attractions, including an art museum (housed in a World’s Fair building), a history museum, a science centre, and the St. Louis Zoo, home to some 5,000 animals. The Missouri Botanical Garden has a traditional Japanese garden.[P8] Recreational areas in the region include a number of state parks (Dr. Edmund A. Babler Memorial, Castlewood, Katy Trail, and Route 66) and state historic sites (First Missouri State Capitol [St. Charles], Scott Joplin House [home of the ragtime composer], Mastodon [a paleontological site], and Sandy Creek Covered Bridge). Several conservation areas are also nearby, including Rockwoods Reservation and August A. Busch Memorial Conservation Area. Across the river near Collinsville, Illinois, is Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site, a prehistoric Native American village. Jefferson Barracks Historic Park is south of the city. St. Louis is the home of the Cardinals (baseball) and Blues (ice hockey) professional sports teams. Several gambling casinos are located along the banks of the rivers.[P9]Busch Stadium, home of the St. Louis Cardinals, 2010.© Melinda Leonard[ML9] [END-OF-CONTENT]
Missouri"Sainte Genevieve"City"Sainte Genevieve county"eastern Missouri"Sainte Genevieve, city, seat (1812) of Sainte Genevieve county, eastern Missouri, U.S. It lies along the Mississippi River, opposite Kellogg, Illinois, approximately 60 miles (100 km) south of St. Louis. The first permanent European settlement in Missouri, it was founded by French Canadians possibly as early as 1735 in what was then the Territory of Louisiana. The original settlement, called LeVieux (“the Old”) Village, was located in Le Grand Champ (“Big Field”), but, following a flood in 1785, it was moved to its present site on higher ground. The community’s French origin is reflected in its Jour de Fête à Ste. Genevieve, a festival held each August, which includes a tour of historic French homes (notably Bolduc and Amoureaux houses), a parade, art shows, a French market, and a display of crafts. The King’s Ball has been held every winter for more than 200 years. A museum contains Native American relics and a display of birds mounted by John James Audubon, the 19th-century American ornithologist, who lived briefly in the city.[P1]Sainte GenevieveBolduc House, Saint Genevieve, Mo.Americasroof[ML1]In 1993 and 1995 hastily built levees saved the historic centre from destruction by floodwaters; several other buildings were damaged, however. Construction of a permanent levee was completed in 2002.[P2]Sainte Genevieve is a trade centre for grain and livestock. Lime is quarried and processed, and light manufactures include leather products, fabricated metals, and clothing. Tourism is also important. Hawn State Park is nearby, to the west.

Missouri"Salem"City"Dent county"southeast-central Missouri"Salem, city, seat (1851) of Dent county, southeast-central Missouri, U.S., situated in the Ozark Mountains between the Current and Meramec rivers. Established in 1845 on the site of an inn and trading post, it was named for Salem, North Carolina. The town was occupied by Union forces during the American Civil War, except briefly in 1864, when raiders burned the courthouse and jail. Union and Confederate troops skirmished in Salem on December 3, 1861. The Dent County Courthouse (rebuilt 1871) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[P1]The development of local iron mines in the 1870s and the arrival of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway Company (Frisco) in 1872 contributed to the community’s growth. The economy is based on the mining of lead, zinc, and copper; lumbering; the production of charcoal briquets; the raising of livestock; and the manufacture of oak barrels and clothing. Tourism is an additional source of income, based on Indian Trail Conservation Area (northeast), Montauk State Park (southwest), and sections of Mark Twain National Forest (south, east, and west).

Missouri"Sedalia"City"Pettis county"west-central Missouri"Sedalia, city, seat of Pettis county, west-central Missouri, U.S., 75 miles (121 km) east-southeast of Kansas City. Established in 1857 by George R. Smith and originally named Sedville for his daughter Sarah (nicknamed Sed), it developed along the Missouri Pacific Railroad right-of-way. It became a Union military post during the American Civil War and was raided by the Confederate general Sterling Price. Generals Nathaniel Lyon and John C. Frémont outfitted Union forces there in 1861. Renamed Sedalia, it was an important railhead for the Texas cattle drive of 1866. With the arrival of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, large railroad shops were built in Sedalia. The city was devastated economically when that railroad closed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Today Sedalia is an agricultural shipping and distribution point and has diversified manufactures, including structural steel, aluminum products, commercial food-service equipment, air compressors, automotive wheels, insulation, tool-storage equipment, and home appliances. Tourism is also important. Composer Scott Joplin wrote and played “Maple Leaf Rag” at the town’s Maple Leaf Club, and the ragtime craze is supposed to have begun there. Sedalia is the site of the Missouri State Fair and the State Fair Community College (1966). Whiteman Air Force Base (1942; originally Sedalia Army Air Base) is nearby to the west. Bothwell Lodge State Historic Site is to the north. Katy Trail State Park, a rail-to-trail conversion that stretches 234 miles (377 km) across Missouri, winds through the city. Inc. 1864. Pop.

Missouri"Springfield"City"Greene county"southwestern Missouri"Springfield, city, seat (1833) of Greene county, southwestern Missouri, U.S., near the James River, at the northern edge of the Ozark Highlands, north of the Table Rock Lake area. Settled in 1829, its growth was slow until the period of heavy westward migration, when pioneers were attracted by its location on important land routes. During the American Civil War the city was held for a few months by Confederate forces after the Battle of Wilson’s Creek (Aug. 10, 1861; fought 10 miles [16 km] southwest) until they were expelled by Union troops in February 1862. James Butler (“Wild Bill”) Hickok lived in Springfield and was a Union scout; he was acquitted there of the murder of gunman Dave Tutt. An extension of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad (1870) resulted in the development of a rival community, North Springfield, which merged with Springfield in 1887.[P1]The city’s agriculture-based economy (dairy products, poultry, stockyards) is augmented by light manufacturing (steel products, paper containers, cleaning products, circuit boards, automotive glass and equipment, food processing), tourism, and educational institutions. The latter include Drury University (1873), Missouri State University (1905), Evangel University (1955), Central Bible College (1922), and Baptist Bible College (1950).

Missouri"Warrensburg"City"Johnson county"west-central Missouri"Warrensburg, city, seat (1836) of Johnson county, west-central Missouri, U.S. It lies 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Kansas City. Named for Martin Warren, an American Revolutionary War soldier and blacksmith who settled in the area in 1833, the town developed as an agricultural trade centre. The arrival of the Missouri Pacific Railroad (1864) stimulated its growth, and flour and woolen mills, grain elevators, and a brewery were built. In the late 19th century Warrensburg was known for its mineral springs; sandstone quarries and coal mines were also in operation. Its economy is now diversified, with agriculture (wheat, soybeans, corn [maize], hay, and cattle) still important. Leading manufactures include circuit boards, lawn mowers, electronic products, batteries, and metal castings. Central Missouri State University (1871) was established in the city as a state normal school. Whiteman Air Force Base, home to the B-2 bomber, is 10 miles (16 km) east of the city.[P1]WarrensburgOld Johnson County Courthouse, Warrensburg, Mo.Abernaki[ML1]The original county courthouse was the scene of the 1870 trial over the killing of the dog Old Drum, at which the future U.S. senator George Graham Vest recited his “Tribute to the Dog,” a classic of American oratory.

Laid out in 1858, it developed as a trade centre for a farming and livestock-raising area. During the American Civil War the town was subjected to numerous raids by both Union and Confederate forces.[P1]Manufactures include flooring, pallets, pet food, furniture, electronic equipment, footwear, and truck bodies. Tourism is important because of the city’s proximity to Lake Norfork and to sections of Mark Twain National Forest, which covers extensive areas around West Plains; the region is also a popular retirement area.

Laid out in 1883 as Copperopolis by Marcus Daly, founder of Montana’s copper industry, the settlement was the seat of Deer Lodge county. In 1977 the governments of Anaconda and Deer Lodge county were consolidated. The city grew rapidly after 1884, when Daly built a copper smelter on nearby Warm Springs Creek. Daly’s plant became one of the world’s largest nonferrous and reduction works, and its 585-foot (178-metre) smokestack dominates the landscape. The city was incorporated in 1888 and was renamed Anaconda, after Daly’s mining camp in Butte, to avoid confusion with Copperopolis in Meagher county. Daly, who had hoped to make Anaconda the state capital, built one of the most ornate hotels in the nation—the Hotel Marcus Daly—there. His newspaper, the Anaconda Standard, had a plant as modern as any in New York City at the time, though it had a readership of only a few thousand.[P1]AnacondaAnaconda Smoke Stack, Anaconda, Mont.Banjodog[ML1]Copper smelting and the manufacture of phosphate products remained the city’s economic mainstay until 1980, when Atlantic Richfield Company, the owner of the Anaconda Company, permanently closed the copper smelter, putting some 25 percent of Anaconda’s workforce out of work.[P2]The city centre’s Washoe Theatre (1931) is on the National Register of Historic Places. Another notable city structure is the Hearst Free Library (opened 1898), donated by Phoebe Apperson Hearst (the mother of American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst).

Lewis and Clark passed through in 1805–06, naming the site now known as Pompey’s Pillar for the infant son of the their guide Sacagawea, whom Clark nicknamed Pomp, or Pompey. A site called Coulson—consisting of a trading post and stagecoach station—was settled in 1877, but in 1882, when the area was surveyed by Northern Pacific Railway Company, the city was renamed for a president of the railroad, Frederick Billings. Prosperity, spurred by the railroad’s arrival, collapsed after 1887 but was renewed after 1900 with the growing cattle industry and irrigated agriculture.[P2]Pompey's Pillar, near Billings, Mont., U.S.Travel Montana[ML2]Billings is the metropolis of the “Midland Empire,” a rangeland and irrigated river valley region producing sugar beets and varied truck crops, wool, and livestock.

Economic expansion was slow until the arrival of the railroads in the 1880s. Copper production, developed by the Anaconda Company, began there in 1882 and by 1900 was yielding half the nation’s output; zinc, lead, and manganese are also found in quantity. The city endured the worst mining disaster in American history in 1917, when an underground fire killed 168 workers. The decline in mining and the increased use of machinery after 1940 brought an economic labour slump, resulting in a 20-year economic plan (the Greater Butte Project) and the inauguration of open-pit mining in the area. The practice was stopped in 1982, and light industry and livestock sales have supplanted mining as the city’s economic mainstays.[P2]The city of Butte and Silver Bow county merged in 1977, officially creating the city of Butte-Silver Bow. Its schools include Montana Tech, a branch of the University of Montana (1893). In addition to the sources of revenue mentioned above, tourism is important.

The community (incorporated in 1885) developed as a wool-shipping point, and the founding there in 1893 of Montana’s first normal school (later Western Montana College) sustained its growth. The city lies between several divisions of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, for which it is headquarters, in an area of old mining camps.

Mount Helena (5,462 feet [1,665 metres]) and Mount Ascension (5,360 feet [1,634 metres]) form scenic backdrops. According to the Federal Writers’ Project guide to Montana (1939), the region in which Helena grew was never the “regular abode” of any Native Americans, although artifacts reveal that they were present periodically, perhaps in hunting parties. The area was traversed by the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1805. Gold was discovered in July 1864 in Last Chance Gulch, now occupied by the city’s main street.[P1]HelenaHelena, Mont.RTC[ML1]The town (named for Helena, Minnesota) was founded on October 30, 1864. It became capital of the territory in 1875 and of the state in 1889. By 1893 the mining boom (based on gold, silver, and lead) had passed, and future prosperity came in cycles—with the building of the Canyon Ferry, Hauser, and Holter dams on the Missouri River (1900–10); with the renewal of mining activities brought about by the demand for metals in World War I; and with the piping of natural gas from surrounding fields.[P2]In addition to state government activities, Helena is an agricultural and livestock trade centre and has light manufactures. It is the headquarters of Helena National Forest, and tourism provides an added source of income. Adjacent East Helena has lead and zinc smelting and refining works. Helena is the seat of the Carroll College (1909; Roman Catholic) and of the Montana Historical Society (with a museum, photo and manuscript archives, a library, and an art gallery). The capitol building has a copper-covered dome surmounted by a reproduction of the Statue of Liberty. Several state recreation areas are near the city. Inc. 1881. Pop.

Montana"Lewistown"City"Fergus county"central Montana"Lewistown, city, seat (1899) of Fergus county, central Montana, U.S. Situated on Big Spring Creek in the dead centre of the state, Lewistown began in 1873 as a trading post on the Carroll Trail. Initially named Reed’s Fort for Major A.S. Reed (who opened a post office there in 1881), the town was renamed in 1899 for an earlier officer, Major William H. Lewis, who in 1876 had established a fort 2 miles (3 km) south. After the arrival of the Central Montana (Jawbone) Railroad in 1903, Lewistown became a distribution point for the Judith Basin, once the scene of a gold rush (1880) but now a wheat and cattle district. Its economy has long depended on local mining activities (coal, gold, silver, and gypsum); its industrial output includes oil and cement products. Tourism is of increasing importance because of the city’s proximity to the Judith Mountains. A state fish hatchery is 7 miles (11 km) to the east. Inc. 1899. Pop.

Founded as Verona (after Varina Davis, wife of the president of the Confederate States of America) in 1863, when gold was discovered in nearby Alder Gulch, it was the first town to be incorporated (1864) in Montana and was the territorial capital from 1865 to 1875. The mines are no longer productive but the town has been reconstructed in the style prevalent during the days of the gold rush. Restored buildings include the offices of the Post, Montana’s first newspaper (issued August 27, 1864). Pro-Northern vigilantes organized there in the 1860s and assassinated several residents, including the sheriff of the Bannack Mining District, suspected of sympathizing with the Confederate cause. The city was renowned for violence long after the end of the Civil War. Tourism, supplemented by livestock raising, is the economic mainstay.

Pawnee Indians were early inhabitants of the area. The city was founded in 1871 at the junction of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad. It was named Kearney Junction for nearby Fort Kearny (a postal error added an “e” to the city’s name), a U.S. Army post (1848–71) that had been established to protect travelers on the Oregon Trail and was named for Gen. Stephen Watts Kearny. During the 1870s and ’80s the city grew with the establishment of a cotton mill and construction of a canal (1886) for irrigation and power. Economic collapse and drought in the 1890s ended the boom period, but in the early 1900s the city began to recover with a diversified economy. Kearney developed as an agricultural centre with light industry. Corn (maize), alfalfa (lucerne), soybeans, and cattle are produced, and the manufacture of automotive parts, engine components, filters, generators, and grain-storage and -handling systems is important. The University of Nebraska at Kearney (1903) is located there. Fort Kearny State Historical Park is across the river about 5 miles (8 km) southeast.

Oto and Pawnee Indians were early inhabitants in the area. Settlers were drawn in the 1850s by the salt flats located nearby. The site was named Lancaster (for the Pennsylvania city) by a salt company representative in 1856. It was soon determined that salt mining would not be feasible (the salt basin is now underwater). The site was chosen as the state capital in 1867 (the year of Nebraska statehood) because crossing the Platte River to reach the territorial capital of Omaha was difficult for those living south of the river (“South Platters”). Lincoln was officially founded that year. A legislator who opposed the capital’s move from Omaha named the new site for Pres. Abraham Lincoln in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the South Platters—many of whom had favoured the Confederacy in the American Civil War—to vote against the change of location.[P1]Nebraska State Capitol, Lincoln.© Timothy Crowe[ML1]The Burlington and Missouri River Railroad from Plattsmouth arrived in 1870, and Lincoln became a railroad junction for the major routes from Chicago to Denver and from Kansas City, Mo., to Billings, Mont. By the 1890s the city had 19 different rail routes. Railroads furnished Lincoln with its most important industry through the establishment of major repair and locomotive shops in suburban Havelock. Havelock, University Place, College View, and Bethany, previously separate towns, were annexed by Lincoln during 1926–30. German settlers from Russia became the city’s largest ethnic group in the early 20th century.[P2]Lincoln is a regional centre of government, commerce, finance, arts, education, and health care. It has extensive rail connections and an airport. Agricultural products include soybeans, corn (maize), sorghum, wheat, hogs, and poultry. Lincoln is a major grain market with milling, grain storage, meatpacking, and farm-equipment distribution businesses. Manufactures include industrial rubber products, motorcycles, watercraft, software, scientific instruments, wireless communication equipment, electrical products, construction materials, turf maintenance equipment, bricks, and pharmaceuticals. Of economic significance is Lincoln’s growth as an insurance centre, with dozens of firms having home offices there. Aviation services, communication technology, railroading, business services, medical research, and printing are also important. Government-operated institutions, including several correctional facilities, also contribute to the economy.[P3]Educational institutions include the University of Nebraska (1869), Union College (1891; Seventh-day Adventist), Nebraska Wesleyan University (1887; Methodist), and a campus of Southeast Community College (1973). There are also several notable museums and art galleries on the grounds of the University of Nebraska. The Nebraska Art Association, the Lincoln Symphony Orchestra, and the Lincoln Community Playhouse provide cultural opportunities. The state capitol, completed in 1932 and Lincoln’s third, was designed by U.S. architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue; its central tower, rising 400 feet (120 metres) from a massive three-story base, is a highly visible landmark. The legislature that meets there became unicameral in 1937 (unique in the United States).[P4]In the early 20th century the political life of the city was dominated by William Jennings Bryan, who lived there from 1887 to 1921. As a young lawyer, Bryan entered politics and went to Congress (1890) from Lincoln, where, after his defeat in the presidential election of 1900, he published his weekly journal, the Commoner. Fairview (1903), the Bryan home, which is today on the grounds of a medical centre, has been restored.[P5]Lincoln is the site of the Nebraska State Fair (August).

The community originated around Fort Kearny (1846; moved west to Platte River site in 1848), was laid out in 1854, and combined in 1858 with the adjacent settlements of Kearney City, Prairie City, and South Nebraska City. It grew as a steamboat port and outfitting point for westbound freight and travelers and was sustained by the arrival of the Midland Pacific Railroad (1871). The Mayhew Cabin (1855), a station for runaway slaves on the Underground Railroad, has been restored; it is part of a site formerly called John Brown’s Cave that includes other restored historic buildings and a tunnel system. The Nebraska Center for the Education of Children Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired dates from 1875. An agricultural economy (corn [maize], soybeans, apples, and livestock) is supplemented by manufacturing (notably gas meters, plastics, and processed foods). The home of J. Sterling Morton (founder of Arbor Day [1872]) is in Arbor Lodge State Historical Park at the city’s western edge, where a festival celebrating the holiday is held each April.

Nebraska"Norfolk"City"Madison county"northeastern Nebraska"Norfolk, city, Madison county, northeastern Nebraska, U.S., on the North Fork Elkhorn River, about 110 miles (175 km) northwest of Omaha. Settled in 1866 by German farmers from Ixonia and Watertown, Wis., its name, originally proposed as North Fork, was abbreviated to Norfork and then changed by the post office to Norfolk. The Native Americans living in the area (Ponca and Omaha) traded with the settlers. Norfolk served as a supply point during the Black Hills gold rush of the 1870s. The economy depends primarily on agriculture (corn [maize], soybeans, and livestock), manufacturing (medical equipment, electronics, steel products, and rubber products), and food distribution. It is a regional transportation and commercial centre. Nebraska Christian College was founded there in 1945 and Northeast Community College in 1973. Willow Creek State Recreation Area is nearby.

Nebraska"North Platte"City"Lincoln county"west-central Nebraska"North Platte, city, seat (1867) of Lincoln county, west-central Nebraska, U.S. It lies at the point where the North Platte and South Platte rivers join to form the Platte River. Founded in 1866 on the Union Pacific Railroad (of which it became a division headquarters), North Platte developed as a centre for the Nebraska Sand Hills cattle industry and the produce of the irrigated Platte valley. Railroading is the basis of the contemporary economy. The North Platte area’s major agricultural products include corn (maize), alfalfa (lucerne), wheat, beans, oats, sorghum, soybeans, and cattle. Business services and the manufacture of doors also contribute to the economy. North Platte Community College, a part of the Mid-Plains Community College system, was established there in 1965, and a University of Nebraska agricultural-experiment station and a state walleye fish hatchery are nearby.

 Nebraska"Omaha"City"Douglas county"eastern Nebraska"Omaha, city, seat (1855) of Douglas county, eastern Nebraska, U.S. It is situated on the west bank of the Missouri River opposite Council Bluffs, Iowa. Omaha is Nebraska’s biggest city and a regional manufacturing, transportation, trade, and service hub. From the 1890s through the mid-20th century Omaha emerged as one of the top livestock markets in the world and a leader in the meat-processing industry. Founded in 1854, it soon became known as a “gateway to the West.” Omaha’s location near the juncture of the Platte and Missouri rivers provides access to the wide, flat valley of the Platte, which has become a vital transportation artery. The city derives its name from the Omaha Indian word meaning “upstream people.” Inc. town, 1854; city, 1857. Area city, 115 square miles (298 square km). Pop. (2000) 390,007; Omaha–Council Bluffs Metro Area, 767,041; (2010) 408,958; Omaha–Council Bluffs Metro Area, 865,350.[P1]Omaha, Neb.Jupiterimages Corporation[ML1] History Omaha was founded in 1854 in an area that had been visited by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1804 on their exploratory journey to the Pacific coast and where the pioneer fur trader Manuel Lisa established a trading post during the War of 1812. Westward-bound Mormons spent the winter of 1846–47 there at an encampment that they named Winter Quarters, later called Florence, which was subsequently annexed by Omaha. From 1847 to 1848 Winter Quarters witnessed the beginning of the Mormon migration to what became the state of Utah, but because the west side of the Missouri River was closed to permanent “white” settlement, the Mormons moved the point for subsequent departures to the nearby community of Kanesville, Iowa (renamed Council Bluffs in 1853).[P2] By the time the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 opened the area to settlement, Kanesville had become the largely non-Mormon community of Council Bluffs, where a group of entrepreneurs created a company for developing Omaha City, Nebraska Territory. The promoters wanted the capital of the newly created territory to be located directly across the Missouri River, in part at least to influence the builders of the then-projected transcontinental railroad to lay their tracks through or near the new city. Omaha’s backers won the territorial capital for their town, despite the aspirations of Bellevue, a long-established trading post, mission, and Native American agency just south of Omaha.[P3] St. Louis-based steamboats carrying passengers and cargo up the Missouri River linked Omaha to the East. By the 1860s stage lines extended in various directions from the city. Freight wagon trains to Denver and other western points contributed to Omaha’s emerging stature as a transportation and supply centre. In 1863 Pres. Abraham Lincoln essentially designated Omaha–Council Bluffs the eastern terminus of the first transcontinental railroad, which, when completed in 1869, placed Omaha at the eastern end of the country’s first rail link to the West and enhanced its stature as an emerging urban centre. Incorporated as a city in 1857, Omaha had 1,883 residents by the eve of the American Civil War. By 1870 the frontier community had a population of 16,083, a figure that nearly doubled a decade later.[P4] Although Omaha lost its capital status to Lincoln after Nebraska entered the union in 1867, during the next two decades more railroads were built through the city. The bridging of the Missouri River in 1872 helped integrate Omaha–Council Bluffs into a national rail network. Smelting, wholesaling, and other enterprises diversified the economy. The establishment of the Union Stock Yards in 1884 soon brought major meat packers to the suburban community of South Omaha, linking the urban area to a vast rural hinterland. In 1888 a traffic bridge linked Omaha and Council Bluffs, and by 1889 electric streetcar service had been established in and between both cities, further integrating the metropolitan area that was developing on both sides of the Missouri River.[P5] In the 1880s Omaha’s population tripled, but a blizzard in 1888, followed by a succession of drought years and a national depression, halted population growth. Hopes lifted, though, when Omaha was selected as the site to host the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition of 1898, an event that was meant to revive the region’s economy and alleviate the financial panic of the 1890s. The exposition attracted more than two million people to the city from June to September. Moreover, in August 1898 an Indian congress—uniting hundreds of Native Americans from more than 30 tribes—was also held in Omaha. In the late 1890s, prosperity had returned to Omaha, and by the turn of the century Omaha had a population of about 100,000, while South Omaha had about 26,000 residents. During 1915–17 several suburban communities, including South Omaha, were annexed.[P6]Map of Omaha, Neb., and vicinity c. 1900 from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML6] Greater Omaha’s broad-based economy attracted settlers from older parts of the United States as well as numerous immigrants from Europe, notably from Bohemia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and Scandinavia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many African Americans from the South also had migrated to the Omaha area. This new diversity caused occasional conflicts. An African American man was lynched in 1891, and a riot in 1909 drove South Omaha’s small Greek community from the city. Between 1910 and 1920 the African American population in Omaha doubled. Ethnic tensions, mainly between blacks and whites, escalated in Omaha, as they did throughout the country, especially in the early peacetime years after World War I. This conflict resulted in the lynching of another African American, William Brown, by white rioters in 1919 in front of the Douglas County Courthouse.[P7] The Great Depression of the 1930s brought hardship to Omaha. Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal provided relief to the city and funded key public projects. For years a local business group had worked to thwart labour unions, and violence accompanied a streetcar strike in 1935. Although the strike failed, the Wagner Act (National Labour Relations Act) of that year heralded federal support for collective bargaining.[P8] The approach of World War II brought the construction of the Glenn L. Martin Company aircraft assembly plant at Fort Crook (now Offutt Air Force Base), adjacent to the small town of Bellevue, on Omaha’s southern outskirts. Aside from boosting the local economy, the plant brought rapid growth to Bellevue. The plant closed in 1945, but in 1948 the advent of the Cold War led to the designation of the plant site as the Strategic Air Command (now U.S. Strategic Command) headquarters. The military presence at the base enhanced the economy of the Omaha area and boosted residential growth in the suburban Sarpy county communities of Gretna, La Vista, and Papillion, all of which lie southwest of Omaha.[P9] Like many U.S. cities, Omaha in the 1950s and ’60s witnessed a strong civil rights movement as African American citizens sought to end discrimination in housing and employment. Poverty and growing militancy among young people, as well as strained police-community relations, contributed to outbreaks of violence. Overt tensions eased in the wake of job programs, civil rights laws, and growing sensitivity among white residents. A federal court ruling that de facto racial segregation prevailed in the Omaha Public Schools led to the busing of students away from neighbourhood schools beginning in 1976 as a means of achieving integration. Mandatory school busing officially ended in 1999 with no consensus as to its value. The Omaha Public School District continued its efforts to improve inner-city education.[P10] By the 1950s Omaha had long been a major food-processing centre. In fact, Omaha surpassed Chicago as the world’s top livestock market in 1955. From the 1960s to the early ’70s, plant obsolescence, labour costs, and pollution problems caused an exodus of major packers from the city. The stockyards closed in 1999, but meatpacking remained a significant part of the local economy; the steak survived as an Omaha icon, and the city remained a food-processing innovator. In the meantime, diversity in the local economy, notably the development of information technology enterprises, established the basis for strong economic growth in the 1990s and early 21st century.[P11] By the late 20th century the city’s Hispanic population had begun to grow rapidly. People of European ancestry comprised about four-fifths of Omaha’s population. African Americans made up more than one-tenth of the population, and the remainder were mostly Hispanics and, to a lesser extent, Asians and Pacific Islanders, as well as immigrants from Africa and the Middle East.[P12] [H3]The contemporary city By the early 21st century, more than half of all the jobs in Omaha were in the service sector. Many large corporations, including the major American insurer Mutual of Omaha Companies, are headquartered in the city. The city is also the home of investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett, the “Oracle of Omaha,” whose firm, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., is a Fortune 500 company. Despite a sharp decline in the local meatpacking industry, food processing remains an important source of employment, and other agriculture-related activities are important to the economy of the metropolitan area. Among the other industries in Greater Omaha are metal fabricating, steel casting, and the manufacture of pipes, farm machinery, truck bodies, and motion-picture projection equipment.[P13]Downtown Omaha, Neb.© Henryk Sadura/Shutterstock.com[ML13] Omaha continues to be one of the largest railroad centres in the United States; it is home to the Union Pacific Railroad Company, which grew vastly through mergers in the 1980s and ’90s. The city is a major trucking destination, and Eppley Airfield has grown rapidly in freight and passenger volume.[P14]Union Pacific CenterUnion Pacific Center, the headquarters of Union Pacific Railroad, Omaha, Neb.Scott Redd[ML14] Omaha’s educational institutions include the University of Nebraska at Omaha (1908), Creighton University (Roman Catholic; 1878), the University of Nebraska Medical Center (1881), the all-women’s College of St. Mary (1923), Grace University (1943), and Metropolitan Community College (1974).[P15] The Omaha Community Playhouse, the Omaha Theatre for Young People, and Opera Omaha are major centres for the performing arts, as is Holland Performing Arts Center, where the Omaha Symphony plays. The Joslyn Art Museum (1931) houses a collection of American and European 19th- and 20th-century works, as well as Native American artwork. Dating from the same period, the former Union Station now houses the Durham Western Heritage Museum. The Great Plains Black Museum in Omaha is one of the country’s largest centres of African American culture and history. A museum dedicated to Latino history and culture opened in Omaha in 1993. In the early 2000s, based on the success of independent label Saddle Creek Records and its flagship band Bright Eyes (fronted by singer-songwriter Conor Oberst), Omaha emerged as an important centre of alternative rock music. Over the years many Omaha natives have made their mark as performers, including actors Marlon Brando, Henry Fonda, and Fred Astaire.[P16] Notable sites include the historic Old Market, the city’s arts and entertainment district; the Gene Leahy Mall, a long, landscaped park in downtown Omaha; the Heartland of America Fountain; and the nationally prominent Henry Doorly Zoo. The Leahy Mall and the fountain were part of a massive modernization project of the downtown and the riverfront that began in the 1970s. Changes in the riverfront landscape since 2002 include the addition of the Qwest Center, a convention hall and arena; a river walk; a sculpture plaza; the U.S. National Parks regional headquarters building; a campus of the Gallup Organization; and new condominiums. For many years civic leaders had sought a symbol for modern Omaha, and the opening in 2008 of the Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge, a serpentine suspension structure linking Omaha to Council Bluffs, may have provided that distinguishing landmark.[P17]Gene Leahy Mall, Omaha, Neb.© Suzanne Tucker/Shutterstock.comAerial view of Omaha, Neb., with Rosenblatt Stadium.Jupiterimages Corporation[ML17] Since 1950 the city has hosted the College World Series, the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s Division I baseball championship, which is played in Rosenblatt Stadium, otherwise the home of Omaha’s minor league franchise.

Nebraska"Plattsmouth"City"Cass county"eastern Nebraska"Plattsmouth, city, seat (1855) of Cass county, eastern Nebraska, U.S., near the confluence of the Platte and Missouri rivers, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Omaha. Oto and Omaha Indians were early inhabitants. French explorers visited the area in 1730, and the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped there in 1804. In 1852 a ferry across the Missouri was started, and the community was founded in 1854. The city developed as a steamboat and stagecoach stop and as a shipping point for lumber, grain, and livestock. With the arrival of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad in 1869 and construction of a bridge in 1880, river traffic declined. Plattsmouth was a farming and railroading community until 1940, when it began to evolve into a commuter and light-industrial suburb of Omaha. The contemporary economy is based on manufacturing (including retail supplies and industrial equipment), agriculture (mainly soybeans and corn [maize]), health care, services, and tourism. The Kass Kounty King Korn Karnival, a harvest festival, is held each September.

First settled by Capt. Silas Garber (state governor, 1875–79), it was laid out in 1872 and named for the warrior-chief of the Oglala Sioux Indians. The arrival of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad in 1879 contributed to the growth of the community. Agriculture (cattle, hogs, corn [maize], wheat, sorghum) is important to the economy. The city is best known, however, as the home of Willa Cather (1873–1947), the novelist who was noted for her portrayals of frontier life on the Great Plains. She used Red Cloud as the setting for many of her novels; it made appearances as the towns of Hanover in O Pioneers! (1913), Black Hawk in My Ántonia (1918), and Sweet Water in A Lost Lady (1923). The Willa Cather State Historic Site contains her letters, notes, and family memorabilia.

The city became an important cattle-ranching area and served as a supply depot during the 1876–77 Black Hills gold rush; it subsequently developed as a trading centre for farmers and ranchers. Agriculture is important to the economy; Sidney lies in the state’s top wheat-growing area, and cattle ranching remains significant. The city also is one of Nebraska’s largest producers of oil and natural gas. Sidney is home to a large outdoor-recreation retailer’s corporate headquarters, which features wildlife exhibits.

Lying above the deep, narrow Black and Boulder canyons of the Colorado River on the Nevada-Arizona border, it was established in 1931 by the federal government as a residential community for personnel employed at Hoover (Boulder) Dam and other local construction projects, including Lake Mohave and Davis Dam. From 1931 to 1935, during the construction of the Hoover Dam, Boulder City housed more than 4,000 workers in 1,500 buildings. After the dam was completed most of the workers left, and Boulder City became a federally administered headquarters for several agencies involved in the dam’s operation. In 1958 the federal government ceded the townsite, then about 33 square miles (85 square km), to Boulder City’s residents. The city charter, approved by voters in 1960, prohibits gambling. In 1979 the city government approved a referendum to control growth, and Boulder City has since limited the number of building permits issued each year; its population grew at a rate of only 3 percent annually in the 1990s, a rate far lower than that of other Nevada municipalities.

Founded in 1858 on the site of Eagle Station (later Eagle Ranch), it took its name from the nearby Carson River, which the explorer John C. Frémont, who explored the region in 1843–44, named for his scout, Christopher (“Kit”) Carson. The city was made the seat of Carson county, Utah Territory, on March 1, 1861, a day before the Territory of Nevada was created by the U.S. Congress; an enterprising citizen, Abraham Curry, had already deeded a 10-acre (4-hectare) plot for the construction of a capital. On November 25, 1861, Carson City became the territorial capital and on November 29 was made county seat of the newly designated Ormsby county. When Nevada became a state in 1864, Carson City became the seat of the new state government. In 1969 the city of Carson City and Ormsby county were consolidated to form one governmental unit called Carson City.[P1]Carson City: Nevada State CapitolThe Nevada State Capitol in Carson City.Glen Allison/Getty Images[ML1]Mormon agriculturists settling in the area influenced the city’s development, as did wagon and stage routes over the nearby Sierra Nevada passes into California. In 1859 discovery of silver in the Virginia City area, 15 miles (24 km) northeast, rapidly stimulated Carson City’s economy. At nearby Empire, on the Carson River, mills treated the ore of the Comstock Lode (one of the world’s richest deposits), brought down from Virginia City by the Virginia and Truckee Railroad, which maintained extensive shops at Carson City. Along with the Comstock, the railroad declined and was abandoned in 1950. To coin the immense silver output of the Comstock, the federal government established a mint at Carson City, which later became the Nevada State Museum.[P2]Mining (copper and some silver) is still an economic factor.

It is a place of superlatives, both positive and negative. Within the city stand the largest glass pyramid in the world; one of the largest hotels in the country, with more than 5,000 rooms; and one of the most expensive hotels ever constructed, the Bellagio. The area along Las Vegas Boulevard and its adjoining near-downtown streets—the famous “Strip”—is the “City Without Clocks,” whose multibillion-dollar economy is devoted to servicing a wide array of impulses and addictions of many kinds. It is this Las Vegas, the flashy playground unofficially known as “Sin City,” that the American novelist and essayist Joan Didion once termed[P3]Paris Las Vegas Hotel and CasinoA replica of the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino.Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com[ML3] the most extreme and allegorical of American settlements, bizarre and beautiful in its venality and in its devotion to immediate gratification. Downtown Las Vegas is built to serve not residents but guests—tens of millions annually. Once derided as a cultural backwater, Las Vegas has evolved into an economic power that outstrips the output of whole countries. It is one of the country’s leading vacation destinations, drawing far more tourists than the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone National Park.[P5] Beyond the bright lights of the Strip, however, lies a perfectly ordinary Western city, with neighbourhoods, churches, shopping centres, and strip malls. It is that city, and not the hotels and casinos, that draws thousands of new residents each year. This growth, coupled with its unusual economic basis, has made Las Vegas one of the wealthiest cities in the country, but it has also brought problems to the area. Las Vegas is among the country’s leaders in personal and property crimes, as well as suicide rates, alcohol consumption, and illegal drug use. The city also suffers the modern urban ills of air and water pollution, and the roads are choked with increasingly heavy traffic as new suburbs spring up in all directions.[P6]Suburban Las Vegas, Nevada.© iofoto/Shutterstock.com[ML6] [H3]Landscape City site Las Vegas’s historic core lies at a site once occupied by marshes, freshwater springs, and grassy meadows (hence the city’s name; vegas is Spanish for “meadows”), long since covered by streets, buildings, and parking lots. The modern-day city sprawls across a broad, arid valley at an elevation of roughly 2,000 feet (610 metres). The valley fans out eastward from the picturesque, pine-clad Spring Mountains, whose highest point, Charleston Peak, rises above 11,910 feet (3,630 metres). To the north lie three lower ranges, the Pintwater, Spotted, and Desert mountains, and to the east are the McCullough and Sheep ranges. A wide pass between those two ranges leads to Hoover Dam and Lake Mead, the huge reservoir on the Colorado River impounded by the dam; Las Vegas Wash, the valley’s major drainage, leads through this route.[P7]Nevada: Red Rock Canyon National Conservation AreaThe desert landscape of Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, near Las Vegas.Bob Wick/U.S. Bureau of Land Management[ML7] Surrounded by mountains, the Las Vegas Valley is a basin that collects the scant rainwater and snowmelt that reach it. Underlying that basin is a series of aquifers that once led out into small springs near the site of what is now the downtown area. These springs, most of which have dried up because of excessive groundwater pumping, historically flowed into the Colorado River toward the Pacific Ocean. The southern limit of the Great Basin reaches to just 15 miles (24 km) north of Las Vegas; its waters, which have no outlet to the sea, disappear into a vast inland desert.[P8] The Las Vegas Valley is ecologically part of the Mojave Desert, whose characteristic plant is the Joshua tree. The smallest of the North American deserts, the Mojave supports significant human settlement only in the Las Vegas area and at a few points along the Colorado River. More than four-fifths of the city’s water supply comes from the Colorado River at Lake Mead. The remainder is pumped from underground aquifers. As more water has been removed from these aquifers, the sandy soils have subsided, leading to fissuring and structural damage of the surface and the formation of large sinkholes. These fissures are compounded by the damage caused by occasional earthquakes; the Las Vegas Valley, particularly its northwest quadrant, lies in an active fault zone.[P9] Climate Las Vegas is hot and dry for most of the year. The average daily temperature is 68 °F (20 °C); the average high is 80 °F (27 °C) and the average low is 56 °F (13 °C). January is the coldest month, with average daily temperatures ranging from 57 °F (14 °C) to 37 °F (3 °C); freezing temperatures are uncommon in the valley but normal for the surrounding foothills. July is the hottest month, with average daily highs and lows of 104 °F (40° C) and 78 °F (26 °C).[P10] Las Vegas lies only some 100 miles (160 km) east of Death Valley, one of the hottest and driest places in the country, with an average annual precipitation of only 4 inches (100 mm). The area has endured rainless periods of up to two years, although on average no year is without some precipitation. Most precipitation occurs in the winter months, when cooler ground temperatures allow moisture-laden clouds from the Pacific Ocean to cross the mountain barrier that normally produces a rain shadow. When rain does fall, it can be torrential and can trigger highly destructive flash floods.[P11] City layout The old downtown at the centre of the city became overshadowed in the 1950s by the Strip, the portion of Las Vegas Boulevard (and adjoining side streets) running some 4 miles (6 km) to the southwest, where the city’s most ostentatious and luxurious hotels, restaurants, casinos, and restaurants were built. The city spreads outward in all directions from Las Vegas Boulevard; the metropolitan area covers all of Clark county, a portion of Nye county to the northwest, and a small part of Mohave county, Arizona, to the southeast. It includes the incorporated areas of Boulder City, Henderson, and North Las Vegas as well as the unincorporated areas of Paradise, Winchester, Spring Valley, Lake Mead Shores, and Sunrise Manor. These areas are joined by several arterial roads, including the Bruce Woodbury (Las Vegas) Beltway, a ring road through the Las Vegas Valley.[P12]Bellagio Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas.© Charles Zachritz/Shutterstock.com[ML12] Las Vegas is an amalgamation of many neighbourhoods. One of the more unusual is the planned community of Summerlin, partly outside the city limits. Built on land that was originally purchased by the wealthy industrialist, aviator, and motion-picture producer Howard Hughes in the 1950s, Summerlin was later developed beginning in 1990. About half of Las Vegas’s population lives in single-family homes located in ethnically homogeneous communities. Another large segment lives in apartments and town houses, many in developments built around golf courses, artificial lakes, and greenbelts that stand in sharp contrast to the tawny desert beyond.[P13] [H4]People From its first settlement by Mormons in the mid-19th century, Las Vegas has been populated predominantly by people of European (white) ancestry. Some three-fourths of the population is white. Only a small proportion of the population today is Mormon. About a third is Roman Catholic, and there is a sizable Jewish minority.[P14]Hoover Dam and Lake Mead on the Nevada-Arizona border.Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty Images[ML14] Several hundred Chinese immigrants were drawn to the region in the mid-19th century to help build the railroad that would join Las Vegas to other cities in the mountain region and on the Pacific coast. About the same time, Basque sheepherders came to the area, introducing an Iberian culture quite distinct from that of Spanish-speaking Mexicans living there. African Americans arrived in the 19th century, most of them as cowboys and seasonal ranch workers, and their numbers grew in the years during and after World War II, when many were stationed in the area for military service or arrived to work in defense-related industries.[P15] African Americans now constitute a substantial minority, more than one-tenth of the city’s population. Hispanics account for more than one-fourth of the total, many of them recent immigrants from Mexico and Central America who work largely in the service sector. Relatively small numbers of Asians and Native Americans round out the city’s ethnic composition, as do Pacific Islanders, who moved to Las Vegas in such numbers that many Hawaiian immigrants refer to it as the “ninth island.”[P16] Ethnic discrimination was common in the city’s earlier days but has subsided somewhat since the late 1960s. Few African Americans or Hispanics worked on the Hoover Dam project during the 1930s, even after the federal government ordered the consortium building it to halt such discriminatory practices; those who were hired were employed only as common labourers. Jim Crow segregation practices were introduced in Las Vegas in 1947 as a means of placating the city’s growing white tourist clientele; only one casino, the Moulin Rouge, which was partially owned by the African American heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis, was open to both blacks and whites. The rest of the city’s casinos voluntarily desegregated in the mid-1950s, but de facto segregation existed elsewhere in Nevada until the mid-1960s. In 1968 Governor Paul Laxalt initiated several far-reaching reforms that were meant to ease growing ethnic tensions. Even so, race riots broke out in 1969 and 1970. From the early 1970s to the early 1990s, Las Vegas schools employed a comprehensive desegregation plan. Although school desegregation experienced setbacks after the plan was dismantled, the overall process of integration continued, and by the early 21st century several African Americans had been elected to the city council.[P17] Americans of Italian and Irish ancestry have long been prominent in the city’s politics, although each group constitutes only a small minority of the population. Since the 1950s Las Vegas has also had a growing homosexual community that has made substantial contributions to its cultural life.[P18] The people of Las Vegas range across social classes, from the very rich, including many new immigrants from Asia and Europe, to the very poor. The numbers of the latter are growing rapidly as immigrants arrive from Mexico and Central America seeking work, usually finding it in the service sector and the manual trades.[P19] [H5]Economy Agriculture formed the basis of the Las Vegas economy from the mid-19th to the early 20th century. The city’s outlying areas continued to depend on farming and ranching until the 1980s, when the rising cost of obtaining subsurface and river water for fields and pastures caused many to abandon their operations. Whereas agriculture had accounted for the vast majority of water use in the area, the city’s municipal needs began to grow with an increase in population. Since the 1990s, Las Vegas has had one of the fastest-growing employment bases in the country, benefiting from a large labour pool and from a favourable business climate. These conditions enabled city promoters to entice businesses of all kinds to choose Las Vegas over California.[P20] Manufacturing Mining constitutes the mainstay of the region’s industrial sector; minerals extracted from the several facilities in the area include silver, gold, lead, and molybdenum. Manufacturing has grown in importance, with most of the plants concentrated in the communities of Henderson and North Las Vegas. Construction has long been a significant component of the economy, serving the rapidly growing population.[P21] Finance and other services Although Las Vegas claims to have a diversified economy, the service sector unquestionably is dominant. In reality, the city is essentially a one-company town—that “company” being gambling and tourism. The growth of tourism has been phenomenal, especially since the city began promoting itself more as a family-oriented vacation destination in the 1990s. In addition, trade shows and conventions account for an ever-growing portion of tourism revenues. The Las Vegas Convention Center is one of the largest such facilities in the country.[P22] Some two-thirds of all jobs in the region are service-related. The largest concentrations are in the numerous hotels, casinos, and other tourist-related enterprises, where wages typically are low. Nonetheless, labour is well-organized, and union membership is high. Government-related employment is also important; Nellis Air Force Base, adjacent to North Las Vegas, is the metropolitan area’s single largest employer. In addition, wholesale and retail trade and financial services are all significant components of the regional economy.[P23] Transportation Until the early 20th century, Las Vegas was isolated from other population centres and was connected to Los Angeles and Salt Lake City by only a wagon route that required weeks to traverse. That changed in 1904, when a line from the San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad to Las Vegas was completed. Today Las Vegas is a regional hub for the Union Pacific Railroad and is served by Amtrak.[P24] The city’s network of county, state, and federal roads is inadequate to meet the transportation needs of the growing population, and Las Vegas Boulevard, portions of the interstate highway, and other arterial roads are often crowded. The city has undertaken a large-scale program of road improvements, the centrepiece of which is the Bruce Woodbury Beltway, constructed as a joint venture with other municipalities in the metropolitan area. The basic road was completed in 2003, and work has continued on converting its entire 53 miles (85 km) into a limited-access highway. The city maintains an extensive bus system, and a privately built and operated monorail connects many casinos and other attractions on the Strip.[P25] McCarran International Airport is among the fastest-growing airports in the country. The Southern Nevada Foreign Trade Zone—a free-trade zone that includes the airport and allows a variety of goods to be imported duty-free or with reduced excise taxes—has increased the region’s attractiveness to international business interests.[P26] [H6]Administration and society Government Las Vegas operates on a council-manager system. The city manager is responsible for the daily operations of government and administration. The city council comprises seven members, including six members elected by ward as well as the mayor, who presides over the council. All serve four-year terms. The council and the city manager’s office oversee a number of commissions and boards.[P27] Municipal services and health Responsibility for providing a range of services to the citizenry is shared by the city, the board of supervisors for Clark county, and the governments of nearby municipalities. Las Vegas maintains an airport and road authority, a municipal court system, police and fire departments, waste-management operations, water treatment and delivery facilities, public parks, and public libraries. The city’s municipal park system expanded rapidly in the late 1990s to include such new facilities as Children’s Memorial Park, northwest of downtown, and Heritage Park, which adjoins the Las Vegas Natural History Museum.[P28] The most important component of the region’s infrastructure is its water supply, and water availability is the largest single variable affecting Las Vegas’s sustainability and future growth. Groundwater long constituted the water supply when agriculture accounted for most regional water use. However, urban water demand rose dramatically with the rapid and sustained growth of Las Vegas after 1950, and planners turned to the vast resources of Lake Mead to provide the additional water. The massive Southern Nevada (now Robert B. Griffith) Water Project, funded jointly by the federal and state governments and built between 1968 and the early 1980s (with subsequent expansion), is a complex of distribution and treatment facilities that draws from Lake Mead and now supplies the bulk of regional water needs. The federal government transferred control of the project in 2001 to the state-operated Southern Nevada Water Authority.[P29] About a dozen hospitals serve the Las Vegas metropolitan area. The University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, part of the University of Nevada system, is a teaching hospital with an emphasis on pulmonary and cardiac disease; it has grown to national prominence in neurosurgery and neurology and maintains the state’s major facility for treating burn victims. Several private institutions offer general medical care and maintain specialized units that treat diabetes, kidney diseases, sleep disorders, and other maladies.[P30] Education Although the Clark county public school system—one of the largest in the country—is held to be good overall, its high schools have an unusually high dropout rate by national standards, and the proportion of high school graduates who enroll in universities and colleges is one of the lowest in the country. Federal and state funding policies have encouraged the development of private schools as alternatives to the public schools.[P31] Higher education in the Las Vegas area centres on the two-year Community College of Southern Nevada, which has several regional campuses, and the four-year University of Nevada, Las Vegas (1957). College tuition costs for state residents are among the lowest in the West.[P32] [H7]Cultural life Las Vegas has had a relatively small number of what might be considered traditional civic cultural institutions—e.g., orchestras, theatre companies, and public art museums—for a city of its size. Instead, much of the city’s cultural life has tended to centre on its casinos and hotels, many of which are masterpieces of monumental architecture; situated along the dazzling promenade of Las Vegas Boulevard, they are open to the public without charge.[P33] Until the late 1980s, Las Vegas casino architecture tended to favour low ceilings (which minimize cooling and heating costs) and dark spaces in which the difference between day and night was indiscernible and thus encouraged patrons to remain there. Entertainment was also geared almost solely toward adults. One of the earliest of these establishments, the Golden Nugget Casino, was in its day the largest of the city’s gambling houses. It became a model for those that followed it, the basic concept being a nondescript building festooned with ever-larger, brighter, and gaudier electric signs. An exception to this model at the time was Caesars Palace, an oval architectural marvel containing numerous large fountains and thousands of tons of imported Mediterranean marble; its spectacular qualities were diminished somewhat by the later addition next door of a multistory shopping mall.[P34] With the construction of such complexes as the Mirage (opened 1989) and Mandalay Bay (1999), Las Vegas casino architecture departed completely from the forms of the 1950s and ’60s, becoming even more spectacular. These newer buildings tended to favour huge atria and vaulted ceilings, sometimes with glass roofs that allowed daylight to enter. In addition, the attractions became increasingly dazzling; among those featured at the Mirage itself were a working model of a volcano, Siberian tigers, and a microcosmic rainforest. More recent additions include replicas of the Eiffel Tower, the New York City skyline, the Grand Canyon, Egypt’s Valley of the Kings, and Venice, as well as a faux-Arthurian castle. These enterprises—which increasingly became resorts for the whole family as much as they were casinos—lent Las Vegas the air of a gigantic theme park, a paragon of what the architecture critic Reyner Banham called the “fantasticating tendency” of the American West.[P35] Inside, the resorts and casinos began displaying other, more traditional treasures. The Bellagio, which opened in 1998, featured a magnificent collection of paintings by such masters as Vincent van Gogh, Jackson Pollock, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, and Henri Matisse. Inside the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, a 12,000-seat sports-and-entertainment complex was installed, inaugurated in 1999 by a series of performances by Italian opera tenor Luciano Pavarotti. The Rio All-Suite Casino has frequently hosted touring exhibits from around the world, including a collection of art from the Hermitage museum in St. Petersburg.[P36]BellagioTime-lapse video by EarthCam of the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens in Las Vegas, Nevada, as it transforms its seasonal exhibit from autumn to winter, featuring its enormous Christmas tree. EarthCam[ML36] Next to casino gambling, nothing more defines Las Vegas in the world’s eye than its renowned nightlife. Visitors have flocked to the city for decades to catch a Vegas show, be it a one-person stand-up comedy act or a lavish production featuring dozens of dancers. The range of shows offered is vast, and famous entertainers at the peak of their popularity—or perhaps just past it—often grace marquees for weeks or months at a time. In addition, the city has become known for its fine dining, dispelling its earlier image of a town with inexpensive, mediocre casino food.[P37] The region does support a number of more conventional cultural institutions, including the Las Vegas Art Museum, Las Vegas Natural History Museum, and Nevada State Museum and Historical Society.[P38] Opportunities for outdoor recreation abound in the area. Two of the most popular nearby attractions include Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, just west of the city, and Lake Mead National Recreation Area, which encompasses a large area that extends into northwestern Arizona. Also within easy reach of the metropolitan area are three state parks—Spring Mountain Ranch (southwest), Floyd Lamb (northwest), and Valley of Fire (northeast). Skiing is available in winter in the Spring Mountains.[P39]Lake Mead National Recreation Area on the Arizona-Nevada border, U.S.© Index Open[ML39] Popular spectator events in the area include two major professional golf tournaments each year, the annual National Finals Rodeo (late fall), and a variety of automobile races at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. In addition, regular air shows at Nellis Air Force Base—the home of the Thunderbirds, the U.S. Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron—draw large crowds. The World Series of Poker is held annually in Las Vegas. In 2017 the city’s first major professional sports franchise, the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League, began play.[P40] Although a resolutely modern city, Las Vegas has taken increasing interest in preserving its historic architecture. Several buildings have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, among them the Las Vegas Mormon Fort (1855), the Little Church of the West (1942), and the Las Vegas Grammar School (1936).[P41] Page 1 of 2 Next page History

Adjacent to Reno is the city of Sparks. Reno’s first settler was C.W. Fuller, who built a toll bridge of logs across the river about 1860. The site was acquired by M.C. Lake in 1863 and was called Lake’s Crossing. When the Central Pacific Railroad reached the site in 1868, a land auction was held, and homes were built almost overnight. The town was renamed for Gen. Jesse Lee Reno of Virginia, a Union officer who was killed at the Battle of South Mountain, Maryland, in the American Civil War.[P1]The Truckee River flowing through Reno, Nevada.Donald Dondero[ML1]Until 1900 Reno served primarily as a distribution point, but, after several well-known people were granted divorces or were quickly married there under liberal state laws, the city became famous as a busy divorce and marriage centre. Close to the Sierra Nevada range and Lake Tahoe, Reno is a year-round vacation centre. Not far from the city is a portion of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, and skiing, hunting, and fishing are available nearby. When gambling was legalized in Nevada (1931), Reno began to attract tourists to its many casinos.

It was almost immediately renamed Sparks in honour of Nevada Governor John T. Sparks, whose ranch was nearby and who unsuccessfully opposed legislation to regulate the railroad’s tariffs. The town grew slowly until the early 1950s, when a postwar building boom saw its conversion into a suburb of nearby Reno. At the turn of the 21st century, Sparks was Nevada’s fourth largest city.

Settled in 1859 and named for a prospector, “Old Virginia” Fennimore, it became a booming mining camp after the discovery of the Comstock Lode (chiefly silver) on nearby Mount Davidson. When the Nevada Territory was created by Congress in 1861, Virginia City had more than three-fourths of the new territory’s population. In the 1870s its population reached 30,000, and there were 6 churches and more than 100 saloons. In 1875 the town was devastated by a fire that destroyed 33 blocks, including the entire downtown district.[P1]Virginia City, Nev., in 1866.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML1]The “bonanza barons,” such as George Hearst and John MacKay, who made millions in the mines, built Victorian-style mansions, and even public buildings were elaborately decorated.

The town was founded in 1638 by John Wheelwright and a group of religious exiles from the Massachusetts Bay colony. During its early years it was a commonwealth independent of the English colonies, but an increasingly unfavourable economic situation forced Exeter to voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of Massachusetts in 1643. Later in the 17th century the area became part of the colony of New Hampshire. From about 1675 to 1725 the town was subjected to numerous Indian attacks, which hindered its growth. A shipbuilding industry subsequently developed. Manufactures now include leather goods, handguns, and electronic equipment.[P1]During the American Revolution Exeter was a patriot stronghold and served as the provincial capital. The Phillips Exeter Academy, a preparatory school, was founded there in 1781.

First called Old Harry’s Town, it became Tyngstown after 1735, when it was granted to Captain William Tyng’s men by the Massachusetts Bay colony. In 1751 it was incorporated as the town of Derryfield. It developed after one of America’s first textile mills was built there in 1805 by Benjamin Prichard. The community was apparently renamed Manchester (1810) at the suggestion of Samuel Blodget, who had seen the barge canals at Manchester, England, and who constructed (1794–1807) the first canal around the falls. That canal, together with the Middlesex Canal in Massachusetts, opened navigation to Boston. Until the late 1930s the city’s economy depended mainly on the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company’s cotton-milling operations. The decline of the textile industry spurred planned industrial rehabilitation. Although financial services are now the city’s main economic activity, Manchester’s manufactures include textiles, aircraft engine parts, automobile accessories, and electrical instruments.

First called Piscataqua and then Strawbery Banke, it became a bustling colonial port. The town, incorporated by Massachusetts in 1653 and named for Portsmouth, England, served as the seat of New Hampshire’s provincial government until the American Revolution. The state’s first newspaper, the New Hampshire Gazette (1756), began publication there. The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (actually in Kittery), dating from the 1790s, has been an important factor in the city’s economic growth. The yard was the site of the 1905 treaty negotiations ending the Russo-Japanese War.

It lies on low, narrow, sandy, 10-mile- (16-km-) long Absecon Island, which is separated from the mainland by a narrow strait and several miles of meadows partly covered with water at high tide. The area was inhabited by Delaware Indians before English settlers arrived in the late 1670s. Development of the island as a summer resort was first envisioned by physician Jonathan Pitney, who arrived about 1820 and wanted to establish a health resort. He later headed a group that persuaded the Camden and Atlantic Railroad to make the place its eastern terminus. Its success spurred construction of another line, the Narrow Gauge Railroad, in 1877.[P1]Atlantic City: BoardwalkThe Boardwalk at Atlantic City, N.J.Italo2712[ML1]Atlantic City’s mild winter climate, tempered by the Gulf Stream, made it a popular resort. Its famous Boardwalk, initially 8 feet (2 metres) wide and 1 mile (1.6 km) long, was built in 1870; it was later extended to a width of 60 feet (18 metres) and a length of 5 miles (8 km). Other innovations enhancing the resort’s reputation included the rolling chair (1884), in which guests were wheeled about, the introduction from Germany of the picture postcard (1895), and saltwater taffy. Amusement piers, jutting from the Boardwalk into the ocean, brought a carnival atmosphere with their vendors, shows, and exhibits. The largest, Steel Pier, is 2,300 feet (700 metres) long. The construction of Convention Hall (1929, new wing completed in 1972), with its 41,000-seat auditorium, made Atlantic City a popular convention site. The Miss America Pageant, held there annually in September, was established in 1921, discontinued in 1928, and revived in 1935.[P2]Atlantic City’s resort trade declined in the decades following World War II. In hopes of reviving the city’s stagnating economy, a statewide referendum legalizing gambling in Atlantic City was passed in 1976. As a consequence, the first legal gambling casino in the United States located outside the state of Nevada opened on the Boardwalk in May 1978. The development of gambling resorts provided an influx of jobs and money, but much of Atlantic City beyond the Boardwalk remained blighted and impoverished.[P3]Tourism remains the mainstay of the economy. The city also is a trade and shipping centre for agricultural products and seafood and has light manufacturing (textiles, candy, glassware, and china).

In 1681, the year before Philadelphia was founded, William Cooper built a home near the Cooper River where it enters the Delaware and named the tract Pyne Point. Settlement, largely by Quakers, was slow. A town site was laid out by Jacob Cooper, a descendant of William, in 1773. It was named for Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden, whose opposition to British taxation policies made him popular with the American colonists. The development of the new village was impeded by the American Revolution, and Camden was often held by the British when they occupied Philadelphia. After 1800 growth was spurred by increased ferry services and the advent of the railroad.[P1]Camden: city hallCity hall in Camden, New Jersey.Smallbones[ML1]Further expansion followed the American Civil War, when important industries were introduced. A steel pen company, the first of its kind in the country, was established in Camden in 1860; the Campbell Soup Company plant was opened there in 1869 and started marketing condensed soups in 1897. The Victor Talking Machine Company, founded in 1894 and purchased by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1929, further developed the phonograph in Camden and manufactured it there for more than three decades. Shipbuilding on the waterfront began about 1899.[P2]In the decades after World War II, Camden’s economy declined as industries closed down or left the city; white, middle-class residents moved to the suburbs.

The 131-foot (40-metre) Edison Memorial Tower, on the spot where the first commercially practical incandescent lamp was made, is capped by a lightbulb 13 feet (4 metres) high and 8 feet (2.5 metres) across; a perpetual light was placed at the base of the tower in 1929. The laboratory buildings were removed in 1929 by industrialist Henry Ford to his Greenfield Village Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. [P1]Menlo Park was established as a rural crossroad in the 17th century after the founding of the East Jersey colony in 1676. It was a part of Raritan township, which in 1954 was renamed Edison township in honour of the inventor.

It is primarily a residential community that includes the fashionable Short Hills district on the north and west. About 1664, colonists from New York purchased land from the Delaware Indians and founded Elizabethtown, which was divided in 1793 when the Springfield township was formed. During the American Revolution the Battle of Springfield (June 23, 1780) took place in the vicinity, and there was fighting around the present town hall.[P1]The area has had many names, including Rum Brook, Riverhead, Vauxhall, Milltown, and Millville. In 1857 the northern part of Springfield seceded and was incorporated as Millburn township, the name originating from Samuel Campbell’s first “mill-on-the-burn [stream],” built about 1790. This so-called Diamond Paper Mill has been transformed into the Paper Mill Playhouse (the State Theatre of New Jersey). Early industries included the manufacturing of paper and hats.

province"New Brunswick"Capital""and soils
The land rises abruptly and in some places spectacularly out of the Bay of Fundy in the south and undulates northward in a series of rolling hills and rocky outcroppings"New Brunswick, Canadian province located on the eastern seaboard of the North American continent. It is Canada’s only officially bilingual province, French and English having equal status. It was one of the four original provinces making up the national confederation in 1867. Together with Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, it forms the regional grouping known as the Maritime Provinces. New Brunswick has a roughly rectangular shape, about 210 miles (340 km) from north to south and 185 miles (300 km) from east to west. It is bounded to the north by the province of Quebec, to the east by the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Northumberland Strait, and to the south by the Bay of Fundy. The latter two bodies of water are separated by the narrow neck of the Chignecto Isthmus, which joins New Brunswick to Nova Scotia, to the southeast. To the west lies the U.S. state of Maine.[P1]Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Lighthouse at Cape Enrage on the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Can.© Paul A. Souders/CorbisNew BrunswickEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML1]Chartered by King George III, the province was named for the royal house of Brunswick, and its capital, Fredericton, was named for King George III’s son Frederick. While New Brunswick has contributed significantly to the national life of Canada, it is one of the smaller provinces and has always occupied a lesser role in the national economy. Its beautiful forests, rivers, lakes, and seashore—attractions for tourists, hunters, and sport fishermen—have remained relatively unspoiled. Area 28,150 square miles (72,908 square km). Pop. (2011) 751,171.[P2] [H2]Land Relief, drainage, and soils The land rises abruptly and in some places spectacularly out of the Bay of Fundy in the south and undulates northward in a series of rolling hills and rocky outcroppings. Plains and flatlands are limited to sea-level marshlands in the southeast, river valley floodplains, and low-lying lands adjacent to the beaches of the east coast. There are no true mountains, although ranges of rugged and sometimes steep hills run east-west a few miles north of the Fundy coast and in the north-central part of the province, where the highest elevation is Mount Carleton at 2,680 feet (817 metres).[P3]New BrunswickEncyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Sand dune beach near Bouctouche, on the east coast of New Brunswick, Can.New Brunswick Department of Tourism and Parks[ML3] This hilly landmass is cut in every direction by an extensive river system. The St. Croix River follows the southwestern boundary. The 418-mile- (673-km-) long St. John River, with its numerous tributaries, drains the entire northwestern, central, and south-central parts of the province. The high tides of the Bay of Fundy reverse the rapids at the river’s mouth at the city of Saint John and raise the level of the lower river for up to 95 miles (150 km) inland. Additionally, a number of lake-size arms branch off the lower St. John on its eastern side, the largest of which is Grand Lake, about 60 miles (100 km) inland. The eastern part of the province is drained by the Restigouche River in the north, the many branches of the Miramichi in the north-central area, and the shorter Petitcodiac in the southeast. Spring flooding is common in many of the rivers.[P4] The majority of soils are acidic and low in nutrients. Most of the well-drained soils are classified as podzols or luvisols. Almost all the cultivable soils have moderate to severe limitations that restrict the range of crops or require special conservation practices.[P5] Climate Clearly distinguishable seasons characterize the climate. Winters are snowy and cold, and summers are mild and pleasant. The fall, with alternating cold nights and sunny warm days, is particularly spectacular, as the blazing colours of deciduous foliage contrast with the solid dark greens of conifers. Temperatures at Fredericton range from an extreme low of −35 °F (−37 °C) to an extreme high of 99 °F (37 °C). In January the mean daily temperature is 14 °F (−10 °C), and in July it is 67 °F (19 °C). Temperatures are more moderate in the southern coastal regions. Normal annual rainfall is slightly above 30 inches (800 mm), and snowfall averages about 115 inches (2,900 mm); annual precipitation (which factors in snowmelt) amounts to about 43 inches (1,100 mm).[P6] Plant and animal life Forests cover the majority of the province, and coniferous trees commonly found in northern temperate climates—such as balsam fir, red and black spruce, pine, and hemlock—constitute the principal growth. Deciduous stands, especially along the river valleys, consist of sugar and red maple, trembling aspen, and yellow and white birch. Wild blueberries and cranberries are found commonly on thin soils, especially in southwestern areas. The forests support substantial herds of white-tailed deer, moose, and small animals such as porcupines and raccoons. The rivers and coasts lie in the eastern flyway of numerous migrating birds, best seen in early to mid-spring and late summer.[P7]Forested hills rising behind a small farm near Waterford, N.B.E. Otto/Comstock[ML7] [H3]People Population composition The English-speaking majority consists largely of the descendants of Scottish, Irish, and English settlers of the 18th and 19th centuries, along with those descended from loyalists who fled the American Revolution. It is concentrated in the southern and western parts of the province. The French-speaking minority, which has grown to about one-third of the population, consists of the descendants of 17th-century Acadian settlers augmented by French Canadians from Quebec, and it is concentrated in the northern and eastern counties. Descendants of the province’s first inhabitants, the Indians (First Nations), remain in small numbers on federally administered reserves (reservations) along the east coast or in the St. John valley, or they have integrated into neighbouring communities. There are several thousand blacks, largely descendants of loyalist slaves, in the province as well. In the 20th century, small contingents of eastern European, Dutch, German, Italian, and Asian immigrants added a multicultural dimension, mostly in the larger urban areas. Roman Catholics outnumber Protestants, who are mostly of the Baptist, United Church of Canada, Anglican, Pentecostal, and Presbyterian denominations.[P8] Settlement patterns Settlement began on the coastline and rivers, where early settlers followed fishing and agricultural pursuits. Small towns tended to spring up along the river systems, which supported sawmills and general stores. Saint John, an all-season ocean port situated at the mouth of the St. John River, has been the largest city from earliest times. Moncton, in the southeast, emerged in the late 19th century as a railroad and distribution centre. Fredericton, the capital and an administrative, educational, and commercial city, is near the geographic centre of the province. Miramichi, located on the river of the same name, is an industrial city that produces paper and other forest products. Bathurst, Campbellton, and Edmundston, small bilingual cities in the north with French-speaking majorities, all developed on the basis of the pulp and paper industry. In the 1950s the Canadian armed forces established Base Gagetown, covering several thousand acres between Fredericton and Saint John, and they built the modern town of Oromocto for army personnel.[P9] Demographic trends Population growth was relatively slight in the early 21st century. Many young adults, drawn by the employment opportunities and higher salaries of central Canadian cities and western oil fields, continued to migrate out of New Brunswick. Within the province, cities became the employment centres, although the common practice of commuting from rural homes or from suburban areas prevented significant urban population growth.[P10] [H4]Economy New Brunswick has a resource-based economy dependent largely on forestry, mining, and fishing. Tourism, agriculture, small-scale manufacturing, and a growing service sector provide balance and diversity. Real economic growth tends to be at or above the regional average for the Atlantic Provinces region, reflecting expansion in oil refining, telecommunications, computer software development, and natural gas distribution.[P11] Agriculture, forestry, and fishing Only about one-fifth of the landmass of the province is suitable for agriculture, and less than one-third of that is actually under cultivation. Floodplains, which represent only a tiny percentage of the provincial landmass, possess the richest soils. They are suitable for truck farming, which is concentrated near the southern cities, notably in the lower St. John River valley. Small family farms remain the most numerous type among the province’s approximately 3,000 farms, but their numbers are dwindling, and thousands of acres of previously cultivated land are returning to forest. The largest farms specialize in the leading cash crops, dairy products and potatoes, the former concentrated in south-central and southeastern areas and the latter in the upper St. John valley. Both benefit from large-scale food-processing plants in their respective areas. Poultry, cattle, hogs, eggs, maple products, and blueberries represent other significant commodities. Provincial policy focuses on soil conservation and new product development.[P12] About four-fifths of the provincial landmass is forested, and the forest industry is the province’s largest. Pulp and paper production represents the industry’s largest single component; several cities and towns, mostly in the north, depend on large pulp and paper mills as their major employers. Sawmills are widespread as well, and other forest products include lumber, plywood, chipboard, fuel, and Christmas trees. The forests also provide a wide range of jobs in related fields. About half of the forested land is in the public domain, although large corporate users are responsible for reforestation and management of assigned districts. Wood supply and fluctuating foreign markets emerged as major challenges in the early 21st century.[P13] The fishing and fish-processing industry continues to be important in the provincial economy. It employs numerous workers in the main fishing areas, including the Bay of Fundy, the Northumberland Strait, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Lobster, crab, scallops, herring, cod, mackerel, and a variety of other North Atlantic species make up the bulk of the catch. The industry is a volatile one, subject to seasonal and longer-term shifts in fish stocks, foreign competition, weather conditions, and credit availability; it has thus become highly dependent on government regulation and support. The development of aquaculture has supplemented the fisheries with hatcheries that produce salmon, trout, mussels, and oysters.[P14] Resources and power The discovery in New Brunswick of rich deposits of zinc and potash in the second half of the 20th century elevated the importance of mining in the provincial economy. The northeast, especially around Bathurst, produces zinc, copper, lead, silver, and peat moss. A lead-smelting operation is at Belledune, a port near Bathurst, and potash and natural gas are found near Sussex. Nationally, the province ranks high in the production of antimony, bismuth, potash, peat, zinc, silver, and lead. Coal, gypsum, and sulfur also are significant.[P15] The provincially owned electric power utility vigorously expanded power generation in the 20th century. Hydroelectric developments along the St. John River system were supplemented by coal- and oil-fired steam-generating units and by the construction of a nuclear power station at Point Lepreau, southwest of Saint John. A power grid links the New Brunswick utility with all the neighbouring provinces and the United States and permits the export of excess capacity. A natural gas pipeline, carrying offshore gas to New England, also crosses the province.[P16] Manufacturing The bulk of manufacturing industries in New Brunswick produce food products, paper, and wood products. Firms also manufacture metal goods, mineral products, and machinery. A number of small computer software companies operate in several of the province’s cities as well. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries both the value of manufactured goods and production volume grew significantly. Canada’s largest oil refinery, located at Saint John, experienced unprecedented growth in response to increasing demand throughout North America.[P17] Services, labour, and taxation By the early 21st century the service sector employed more than three times as many people as did manufacturers. Tourism is a leading service industry, as the province’s natural and cultural attractions, including many picturesque drives, draw many visitors. The province’s advanced telephone system and bilingual workforce have attracted a telemarketing industry with call centres in several towns and cities. In addition, the federal government, through the work of its National Research Council, has encouraged the development of the information technology industry in New Brunswick.[P18]Scenic drive along the coast of New Brunswick, Can.New Brunswick Department of Tourism and Parks[ML18] Employment levels in the province are subject to seasonal variation, and unemployment rates in the early 21st century were slightly higher than the rates in Canada as a whole. Nevertheless, rates of employment showed improvement over past decades. Trends in the previous century had kept unemployment rates fairly high: a lack of diversification in the resource-based economy, high transportation costs, and a decline in manufacturing had reduced opportunities and contributed to significant out-migration.[P19] The province derives the overwhelming majority of its revenue from various taxes. These include corporate and personal income taxes, capital taxes, a value-added sales tax, a real property tax, gasoline and fuel taxes, and a tobacco tax. The provincial budget also depends on federal equalization grants and other federal transfer payments. Such programs support the provision of economic infrastructure, such as in transportation and research, and have contributed substantially to the development of up-to-date amenities and services comparable to those found elsewhere in Canada.[P20] Transportation and telecommunications At Saint John, a modern ocean port and the province’s largest industrial centre, oil refining, shipbuilding, and papermaking are major employers. The city’s port facilities are able to handle container ships, and they play an important role in exporting Canadian goods, especially in winter months when traffic on the St. Lawrence Seaway is curtailed. Moncton and Saint John remain major transportation and communication centres despite the reduced importance of railroads, and Moncton has emerged as an important regional distribution centre. Regional and national airlines provide regular service to all the larger cities, and a bus service links most urban centres. Heavily traveled highways link New Brunswick and the other Maritime Provinces with central Canada and the United States. The 8-mile (13-km) Confederation Bridge connects New Brunswick to Prince Edward Island.[P21]Confederation Bridge over the Northumberland Strait, connecting New Brunswick to Prince Edward Island, Can.© darlenemunro/Fotolia[ML21] New Brunswick possesses a technically advanced telecommunications infrastructure. Cable and satellite television services, wireless telephone service, and Internet access are all widely available. In addition, all public schools have access to the Internet.[P22] [H5]Government and society Constitutional framework The provincial government follows the constitutional forms of a Canadian province within the framework of the Canadian constitution. A lieutenant-governor, appointed by the governor-general of Canada on the advice of the Canadian prime minister, represents the queen and is the titular head of government. A premier and a cabinet exercise real power. The premier is the leader of the political party with the most elected members in the province’s one-chamber legislature. Three national political parties are active. But although the New Democratic Party established a small foothold in the late 20th century, the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives continued their dominance into the 21st century.[P23]Legislative Assembly Building, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada.Courtesy Diane Mercier-Allain, Visitor Services, Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick[ML23] Health and welfare The province has a network of modern hospitals, the largest of which are regional hospitals with specialized facilities and equipment. Hospital and medical care are both publicly funded and are supported by a provincial sales tax. Social services are administered by the provincial government, and the same standards apply provincewide. A provincial housing authority plans and develops projects for low-income families and for the elderly. Health, education, and social welfare programs all receive partial federal financial support.[P24] Education Public education is free and includes kindergarten and 12 grades of elementary and high school. The system, unique in Canada, is administered by separate English and French sections of the provincial Department of Education and by elected school boards in a number of school districts, some French and some English. Teachers negotiate their salaries with the province, which raises and distributes funds to school districts on the basis of equality so that all areas of the province enjoy similar standards. All universities receive public funding but also rely on student tuitions and private contributions. The University of New Brunswick (established 1785), one of Canada’s oldest higher educational institutions, operates from its main campus in Fredericton, which it shares with the Roman Catholic St. Thomas University; a second campus is in Saint John. The University of Moncton serves the French-speaking population from its campuses in Moncton, Edmundston, and Shippagan (Shippegan). Mount Allison University, once a private denominational college but now both publicly and privately funded, is in Sackville. There are also several trade and technical schools.[P25] [H6]Cultural life Culture is shaped by the predominance of the two largest linguistic groups, English and French. Ethnicity remains a strong determinant of cultural activity in some areas, as in the annual Irish festival held at Miramichi, the blessing of the Acadian fishing fleet at Caraquet, and Loyalist Days in Saint John. Summer festivals and fall fairs retain the flavour of the past and the traditions of the province’s early settlers. Popular tastes in music include Irish, Scottish, and Acadian folk idioms and their North American country music derivatives.[P26] The arts The fine arts are distinguished by some outstanding work in painting, choral singing, and creative literature. Saint John artists of the 1930s and ’40s, such as Miller Brittain and Jack Humphrey, produced striking social commentaries in their depictions of depression and war, while painters at Mount Allison University led the way in the 1960s in the development of a widely recognized regional group of magic realists. Divergent trends of the 20th century are represented by the works of two Fredericton artists: Molly Lamb Bobak, who painted crowd scenes and floral watercolours, and her husband, Bruno Bobak, who painted vibrant landscapes. Acadian choirs from the province, particularly the Moncton area, have won both national and international attention. Regional and provincial music festivals encourage music performance among youth, and internationally known musicians perform at summer chamber music festivals in Lamèque and Fredericton. Fredericton also claims to be the poets’ corner of Canada: it is the home of the literary magazine The Fiddlehead, whose founder, the prolific poet Fred Cogswell, and others carried on a tradition first established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Bliss Carman and Sir Charles G.D. Roberts, arguably the founders of Canada’s first school of poetry. Founded in 2000, the Northrop Frye bilingual literary festival in Moncton has attracted international participation. Antonine Maillet, an Acadian novelist and playwright from Bouctouche, achieved international recognition for her writing in French, which strikingly reveals the 17th-century idiom and structure of the language as spoken by today’s Acadians.[P27] Cultural institutions Several institutions provide leadership in the arts. Theatre New Brunswick and the University of Moncton promote drama. The Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton houses an excellent small collection of British, Canadian, and other paintings of the past three centuries. Notable works include The Fountain of Indolence by J.M.W. Turner, Santiago el Grande by Salvador Dalí, and a significant collection of paintings by Canadian artist Cornelius Krieghoff. Several towns have public and private galleries featuring mostly regional work. The New Brunswick Museum in Saint John, the oldest in Canada, contains archival treasures from the province’s past, while two historic reconstructions—King’s Landing Historical Settlement near Fredericton and Acadian Village near Caraquet—depict rural life of the past century. Such historic sites as Fort Beauséjour National Historic Park near Sackville remind visitors of the Indian, French, and British roots of the province. A provincial agency fosters cultural activity and has been especially successful in developing and promoting fine crafts. Craft fairs featuring excellent work in wood, pottery, and other media are very popular in summer and fall. Scholars rely on university libraries, the archives of the New Brunswick Museum, the Provincial Archives in Fredericton, and the Centre for Acadian Studies at the University of Moncton. Municipal libraries are widespread.[P28] Sports and recreation Recreational activities fall into two groups, winter and summer. Skiing, hockey, and curling dominate in winter. Summer recreation focuses naturally on water: boating, swimming, and fishing flourish in a province that abounds with lakes, rivers, and accessible seashore, including miles of clean sandy beaches along the east coast. Several rivers are famous for their Atlantic salmon, while trout, bass, and pickerel also attract sport fishing. Whale watching near the western islands of the Bay of Fundy is popular as well. Other common outdoor pursuits include golf, tennis, and hunting; a regulated hunting season occurs in the fall of the year. Two national parks—Fundy National Park on the rugged coast of the Bay of Fundy (featuring the world’s highest tides) and Kouchibouguac National Park on the Northumberland Strait—and several provincial parks provide camping, bird watching, and hiking. Well-maintained walking and bicycling trails have replaced rail beds in many parts of the province.[P29]Fundy National Park, New Brunswick, Can.New Brunswick Department of Tourism and Parks[ML29] Media and publishing Several major daily newspapers circulate in the province. Among the leading English-language dailies are the Telegraph-Journal (Saint John), the Daily Gleaner (Fredericton), and the Times and Transcript (Moncton). The main French-language daily is L’Acadie Nouvelle (Caraquet). Television broadcasting derives mainly from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), CTV Television Network, Global Television Network, and Radio-Québec. Cable and satellite television also are available. French- and English-language radio stations broadcast throughout the province.[P30] [H7]History The French were the first Europeans to lay claim to the province, part of a larger region that they called Acadia (French: Acadie), which was inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Indians (First Nations) of the Micmac, Malecite, and Passamaquoddy nations. The British took over Acadia in 1713, although the French claimed and defended the area that is now New Brunswick until they were defeated militarily in the 1750s. The British expelled or dispersed most of the French-speaking Acadian settlers in 1755 (many of whom eventually returned) and governed the area as Nova Scotia until 1784, when New Brunswick was established as a separate province with its present boundaries.[P31]Seal of New Brunswick, Can.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Coat of arms of New Brunswick, Can.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML31] The first English-speaking settlers, from New England, moved into the St. John River valley and founded the town of Maugerville in 1762. But it was the influx of some 14,000 loyalist refugees from the American Revolution, mostly from New York and its vicinity, that created the pressure for separate provincehood. The loyalist city of Saint John became Canada’s first incorporated city in 1785, and smaller settlements were established in the St. John and St. Croix valleys.[P32] After early problems of adjustment the loyalist communities of New Brunswick began to prosper. Underlying the improved economy was the British decision in 1808 to grant preferential tariffs to the timber resources of its North American colonies, a move made when Napoleon I’s blockade cut off the Baltic supply of shipbuilding materials to the British. For New Brunswick, with its limited agricultural lands but widespread forests, this historical incident provided an opportunity that helped usher in the so-called age of wood, wind, and water, an era of prosperity based on timber exports and shipbuilding. The Reciprocity Treaty with the United States in 1854 and the demand created by the American Civil War further stimulated trade.[P33] Politically, the province moved slowly toward a more democratic system. Government in the first generation was dominated by a loyalist elite supported by British imperial authority. Responsible home government (government in which the executive branch is drawn from, and answerable to, an elected legislative branch) was granted by Britain in 1848. Political parties, organized largely along ethnic and religious lines and prompted by the prohibition issue, emerged in the 1850s. With its economic success and political independence, New Brunswick entered confederation with Canada in 1867 somewhat reluctantly.[P34] Confederation, however, coincided with the collapse of the age of wooden ships, and New Brunswickers found themselves scrambling over the next 100 years to rebuild their economy on a new foundation. Railroads and national tariffs helped in the development of manufacturing, such as that of cotton textiles, but the province suffered from the pull of the urban growth areas of Quebec and Ontario. By the 20th century, New Brunswick required federally subsidized freight rates, and it argued, along with other Maritime Provinces, for federal financial assistance, which, after the mid-1900s, it obtained.[P35] Meanwhile, a modern party system emerged in which, until the 1970s, the old elements of ethnicity and religion continued to be significant. Liberals and Progressive Conservatives alternated in government at fairly regular intervals. In the mid-20th century, both parties sought economic development based on new electrical power facilities. In the 1960s a Liberal equal opportunity program revolutionized the delivery of health, justice, education, and social services by abolishing counties as administrative units and by centralizing funding and administration at the provincial level. Unique in Canada, the system met strong early resistance, but it continued under the subsequent Conservative government and won acceptance, especially in less-prosperous rural and northern areas, as a means of equalizing services in all parts of the province. Since the late 1980s, both Liberal and Conservative governments have emphasized fiscal restraint, balanced budgets, the restructuring of public services, and a reduction in dependence on federal financial support. In the 1990s and early 21st century, governments continued to pursue economic self-sufficiency.[P36] New Brunswickers think of their province, with its two languages and cultures, as a microcosm of Canada. Moreover, the province’s small size tends to promote support for Canadian federalism among members of both linguistic groups. Even at the beginning of the 21st century, the province retained qualities of its rural and small-town past.[P37] Stephen E. Patterson [END-OF-CONTENT]
New Jersey"New Milford"Town"Bergen county"northeastern New Jersey"New Milford, borough (town), Bergen county, northeastern New Jersey, U.S., immediately north of Hackensack on the east bank of the Hackensack River. Early Dutch settlers established a plantation-type farm called Vriesendael, which was pillaged by Delaware Indians in 1643. In 1675 David Demarest (or des Marest), a French Huguenot, and his sons received a land grant, which included the former farm area. Two years later they established the first permanent settlement. Their mill, known as Demarest Landing, became a shipping point for iron ore. The home of Demarest’s son Samuel is preserved in replica near the Steuben House Museum; the house of another son, David, stands on River Road. The New Bridge Inn (1739) is still in operation.[P1]Originally included in Palisades township (organized in the 1800s), the borough was established in 1922 when three small settlements—Peetzburg, New Milford Manor, and New Bridge—amalgamated and incorporated as New Milford. Though primarily a residential suburb of the New York City region, there is a local facility for processing and packing spices. Pop. (2000) 16,400; (2010) 16,341.[P2] [END-OF-CONTENT]
New Jersey"Newark"City"Essex county"northeastern New Jersey"Newark, city and port, Essex county, northeastern New Jersey, U.S. It lies on the west bank of the Passaic River and on Newark Bay, 8 miles (13 km) west of lower Manhattan Island, New York City. Newark was incorporated as a city in 1836. Pop. (2000) 273,546; Newark-Union Metro Division, 2,098,843; (2010) 277,140; Newark-Union Metro Division, 2,147,727.[P1]NewarkNewark, N.J.Comstock/Thinkstock[ML1] [H2]History Puritans migrating from Connecticut founded Newark in 1666 on land purchased from Delaware Indians. The settlement, first named Pesayak Towne and later New Milford, was probably renamed for the home of the Reverend Abraham Pierson, who went there from Newark-on-Trent, England. Another version holds that the name was of biblical significance (New Ark). Newark became the seat of Essex county (1682) and was chartered as a township in 1693.[P2] After the American Revolution, Newark became (c. 1790) noted for leather tanning, jewelry, and shoe manufacturing. The shoe industry profited greatly from the inventiveness of Seth Boyden, who, regarded by Thomas Edison as one of the greatest American inventors, came to Newark from Massachusetts in 1815 and developed a process for making patent leather (1818). He is credited as the first producer of malleable cast iron (1826) and as a developer of an improved, larger strawberry. There is a statue of him in Washington Park. Newark’s other industrial pioneers included the Reverend Hannibal Goodwin, who patented a flexible film for motion pictures (1887), and Edward Weston, who invented electrical measuring instruments (1888).[P3] From the 1950s through the ’70s there was an outward movement of population from Newark that fundamentally altered its ethnic composition, a change that accelerated after the city was wracked by rioting in 1967. The movement of whites to the suburbs raised the proportion of African Americans in the city from less than one-fifth in 1950 to about three-fifths by the 1990s. African Americans obtained some political power in Newark in 1970, when the city elected its first black mayor, Kenneth A. Gibson. Newark has faced increasing rates of poverty, infant mortality, and citizens infected by the AIDS virus.[P4] [H3]The contemporary city Newark’s proximity to New York City places it within the country’s most highly industrialized and populous area. The city is the largest in New Jersey and is a leading industrial centre. Its manufactures are highly diversified and include electronic equipment, leather goods, chemicals, rubber, jewelry, furniture and fixtures, textiles, industrial machinery, and foodstuffs. Printing, publishing, and the insurance business are also significant. Newark is a transportation centre and a major East Coast distributing point. Newark International Airport is one of the world’s busiest, since it serves both Newark and the New York City area. The Port of Newark, started in 1915, is now leased and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.[P5] Located in Newark are the New Jersey Institute of Technology (1881), the Newark campus of Rutgers University, a branch of Seton Hall University (1856; Roman Catholic), Essex County College (1968), and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (1956). Near the city centre is Military Park, used as a drill ground in colonial times and now the site of a bronze group of figures, The Wars of America, by Gutzon Borglum. Branch Brook, a county park, is noted for its Japanese cherry trees. In front of the county courthouse, designed by Cass Gilbert, is a seated statue of Abraham Lincoln, also by Borglum. Historic buildings include Trinity Cathedral (1733), used as a hospital during the revolution; House of Prayer (1850), with its older stone rectory, Plume House (1710); and the First Presbyterian Church (1790). Adjacent to and part of the Newark Museum (which has a variety of exhibits) is the Ballantine House (1880s), a restored Victorian mansion. The New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC; 1997), across from Military Park, is a multipurpose venue with fine acoustics and a mix of small and large performance spaces; it is home to the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. Several blocks away, near City Hall (1908) and the Depression-era Newark Penn Station (which serves Amtrak, subway, and commuter trains), is the Prudential Center (2007), venue for the New Jersey Devils ice-hockey team and host to other sports and entertainment events.[P6]A discussion of museum director John Cotton Dana and the Newark Museum in New Jersey, from the documentary Riches, Rivals, and Radicals: 100 Years of Museums in America.Great Museums Television[ML6] Notable Newark residents have included singers Sarah Vaughan and Dionne Warwick; Mary Mapes Dodge, author of Hans Brinker, or the Silver Skates (1865); and poet Edmund Clarence Stedman.

 New Jersey"Ocean City"City"Cape May county"southeastern New Jersey"Ocean City, resort, city, Cape May county, southeastern New Jersey, U.S., on a barrier island between Great Egg Harbor (bridged to Somers Point and Longport) and the Atlantic Ocean, 12 miles (19 km) southwest of Atlantic City. Laid out in 1879 by Methodist ministers as a Christian seaside resort, it has remained faithful (by public vote) to its founders’ stipulation that no alcoholic beverages be sold; this has made it a popular place for religious conventions and family vacations. In the 1950s the evangelist Billy Graham broadcast his radio program from Ocean City. It has developed as a fishing and summer resort with marinas and boatyards, 8.5 miles (14 km) of public beaches, and a 2.5-mile (4-km) boardwalk, built in 1928.[P1]A number of large mansions, built by wealthy Philadelphians at the beginning of the 20th century, has left a Victorian imprint on the city. The nearby Richard Somers House (1726), home of the U.S. naval hero of Barbary Coast fame, is a state historic site. The Ocean City Historical Museum contains valuable relics salvaged from industrialist John D. Rockefeller’s ship Sindia, which was wrecked offshore in 1901. To the south lie the Marmora Coastal Wetlands, and across the harbour to the east is the Tuckahoe–Corbin City Fish and Wildlife Management Area. Aside from tourism, boatbuilding is the city’s economic mainstay. In October 2012 Hurricane Sandy caused extensive flooding and property damage throughout Ocean City that in some areas covered the island from the ocean to the harbour. Inc. 1897. Pop.

New Jersey"Orange"City"Essex county"northeastern New Jersey"Orange, also called City of Orange, township, Essex county, northeastern New Jersey, U.S. It lies just west of Newark. Named Mountain Plantations when it was settled in 1678, it was later renamed to honour William, prince of Orange, who became William III of Great Britain. Orange was a part of Newark until 1806, when it became a separate community.[P1]In the early 1800s the discovery of mineral springs in what is now West Orange brought about an influx of hotels and tourism. East Orange and West Orange separated from Orange in 1863, and South Orange was created in 1869; these municipalities, along with Maplewood, now constitute a suburban community called “The Oranges.” They are mainly residential suburbs of New York City and Newark, the first commuters having arrived with the completion of a railroad in 1838. With the Industrial Revolution, Orange became a manufacturing centre for shoes and hats, since replaced by petroleum products, tools, electrical equipment, business machines, and printing products.

New Jersey"Parsippany–Troy Hills"Town"Morris county"northeastern New Jersey"Parsippany–Troy Hills, township, Morris county, northeastern New Jersey, U.S. The township extends eastward from the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains to the Passaic River swamps, 23 miles (37 km) west of New York City. Communities within the township include Manor Lakes, Lake Hiawatha, Lake Parsippany, Lake Intervale, Glacier Hills, and Sedgefield.[P1]Early settlers to the area were the missionaries Abraham and Zackariah Baldwin, and local iron-ore deposits attracted other settlers. About 1713 John Cobb set up a forge at what then became known as Forge Pond in Troy. In the mid-18th century David and Samuel Ogden established the Boone Town Iron Work beside the Rockaway River, the site of which is now covered by the Jersey City Reservoir. Historic houses include Beverwyck and the home of William Livingston, New Jersey’s first governor. Parsippany, the name of which has had more than 50 different spellings, is derived from Parsippanong, a Delaware Indian name for a local stream, meaning perhaps “the place where the waters rush through.”[P2]The name Troy appears on maps prior to the American Revolution, but its origin is unknown. Originally, Parsippany and Troy Hills were included in Whippanong township (renamed Hanover in 1740). The two communities amalgamated and were incorporated in 1928 when Hanover township was divided into smaller units. Mainly residential, the township has diversified manufacturing, including industrial machinery, clothing, computers, food processing, chemicals, and cosmetics. Area 24 square miles (62 square km).

New Jersey"Passaic"City"Passaic county"northeastern New Jersey"Passaic, city, Passaic county, northeastern New Jersey, U.S., on the Passaic River, 9 miles (14 km) north of Newark. It was established by the Dutch in 1678 as a fur-trading post. In 1685 Hartman Michielson purchased the site, then called Acquackanonk, from the Delaware Indians. It was renamed for the Passaic River in 1854. During the American Revolution it was occupied by General George Washington’s troops, and following their retreat, the British general Lord Cornwallis was quartered there. Passaic thrived as a river port until the completion of the Morris Canal between Newark and Phillipsburg (1831), and the building of the railroad reduced river commerce even further. With the construction of a dam (c. 1850) Passaic became a textile centre. Industrial expansion brought a growth in the population—from 6,532 in 1880 to 54,773 in 1910—the increase including large numbers of eastern European immigrants, especially Hungarians, Slovaks, and Poles.[P1]Once a leading woolen producer, Passaic’s last mill ceased operation about 1955. The city was the scene of serious labour struggles, notably a construction workers’ riot (1906) and textile strikes (1926) that involved wage cuts and the right of free assembly. Still an industrial city, its chief products now include rubber goods, plastics, home furnishings, chemicals, leather goods, textile machinery, and clothing. Inc. 1873. Pop.

New Jersey"Paterson"City"Passaic county"northeastern New Jersey"Paterson, city, seat (1837) of Passaic county, northeastern New Jersey, U.S., situated on the Passaic River, 11 miles (18 km) northwest of New York City. It was founded after the American Revolution by advocates of American industrial independence from Europe (including the statesman Alexander Hamilton) who saw the Great Falls of the Passaic, which drop 70 feet (21 metres), as the best potential industrial site on the Atlantic Seaboard. Paterson was one of the first planned industrial cities in the United States. The enterprise was chartered by the New Jersey legislature in 1791 as the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures (SUM); the city was named for Governor William Paterson, one of the framers of the U.S. Constitution.[P1]Great Falls on the Passaic River at Paterson, New Jersey.George E. Jones III/Photo Researchers[ML1]A successful enterprise, SUM ultimately sold waterpower and building space to private manufacturers. The earliest industries were cotton mills (1794), and in 1828 Paterson mechanics joined mill workers in the first recorded sympathy strike in the United States. Samuel Colt produced his first revolvers at the Old Gun Mill (preserved) in 1836. By 1837, when the locomotive industry was established, machine manufacturing had become important. Paterson was producing four-fifths of all locomotives made in the United States by the early 1880s. The silk industry was introduced in 1838, which led to it being named “silk city”; linen thread manufacture began in 1864. By the 1880s Paterson was home to more than one-third of all silk factories in the United States. The city was the scene of many labour disputes, but by the mid-20th century it had become a centre of widely diversified industrial activity. Modern manufactures include textiles, machinery, machine tools, plastics, leather goods, cosmetics, packaging, and chemicals.[P2]The William Paterson College of New Jersey—which was established in 1855 as a normal (teacher-training) school—is located at nearby Wayne. Paterson Museum is known for its collection of New Jersey rocks and Native American relics. Two of the first successful submarines, the Holland I and the Holland II, or Fenian Ram, which were built by John P. Holland and sunk in the Passaic in 1878 and 1881, respectively, were later recovered; they are now on exhibit at the Paterson Museum. Lambert Castle (1891) in the Garret Mountain Reservation houses the Passaic County Historical Society Museum. In 1970 the Great Falls area was designated a national historic site. William Carlos Williams wrote a five-volume poem (1946–58) called Paterson; it focuses on the city and on the Passaic River. Inc. 1851. Pop. (2000) 149,222; (2010) 146,199.[P3] [END-OF-CONTENT]

Settled in the late 17th century, it was the capital of the East Jersey colony from 1686 to 1702, and, after East and West Jersey were united to form New Jersey province, it served with Burlington from about 1738 to 1790 as the alternate provincial capital. The last royal governor of the colony was Benjamin Franklin’s son William. During the American Revolution, Perth Amboy was occupied by the British (1776–77) who later evacuated it when General George Washington seized northern New Jersey.[P1]A brickmaking industry developed there in the 1850s. Industry is now well diversified and includes oil refining, electrolytic copper refining, and the manufacture of chemicals, plastics, clothing, and nails. The city’s original name, Amboy, is of Native American origin. Later, Perth was added in honour of an early proprietor of East Jersey, James Drummond, 4th Earl Perth. Perth Amboy is usually regarded as the place where the first African American person (Thomas Mundt Peterson) voted (March 31, 1870) in the United States. Inc. 1718. Pop.

First known as Stony Brook for the Long Island home of one of the settlers, it was renamed in 1724 to honour the life of William III of England (the former prince of Orange and Nassau). Its location on the Philadelphia–New York City stagecoach route and the relocation there of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) from Newark (after having been founded in 1746 in Elizabeth) enhanced its development as a cultural and legislative centre. Nassau Hall (1756), the principal structure of the college, changed hands three times during the American Revolution’s Battle of Princeton, and the engagement ended within its walls, with General George Washington’s troops defeating a British detachment (January 3, 1777). The New Jersey state legislature convened in Princeton the following summer, and the Continental Congress was assembled there from June to November 1783.[P2]In addition to the university, other educational institutions include the Institute for Advanced Study (1930), where Albert Einstein spent his final years, Princeton Theological Seminary (1812), Westminster Choir College of Rider University (1926), and American Boychoir School (founded 1937 in Columbus, Ohio; moved to Princeton in 1950). The Educational Testing Service, developers of achievement tests for schools, has its headquarters in Princeton. More than 50 national and international corporations maintain research installations in the borough. Communication services, publishing, and pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing are important to the economy.[P3]Morven (1701)—home of the prominent Stockton family, headquarters for the British general Lord Cornwallis during the American Revolution, and former official residence for New Jersey governors—is now a museum.

On January 2, 1777, the British general Lord Cornwallis arrived in Trenton, but Washington withdrew to Princeton, New Jersey, where he defeated a British detachment under Colonel Charles Mawhood. Trenton served as the temporary capital of the United States in 1784 and again in 1799; the city became the capital of New Jersey in 1790.[P2]The completion of the Delaware and Raritan Canal and the Camden and Amboy Railroad in the 1830s spurred Trenton’s industrial development, which since the 1730s had included the iron industry. The industrialist Peter Cooper opened a rolling mill in Trenton in 1845; in 1848 the engineer John Roebling moved his wire mill there, where he manufactured cable for suspension bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge; and in 1868 Cooper’s partner, Abram Stevens Hewitt, introduced into the United States the open-hearth process for making steel. Potteries have operated in Trenton since 1723, and in the late 19th century Walter Scott Lenox developed an international reputation with the fine china his firm made in Trenton. The railroad, trucking, rubber, plastics, metalworking, electrical, automobile parts, glass, and textile industries are now among the city’s foremost enterprises.[P3]American Civil War: New JerseyDiscover how New Jersey's industrial might, exemplified by the Trenton Iron Works, contributed to the Union military effort during the American Civil War.© Civil War Trust[ML3]The College of New Jersey was founded in Trenton in 1855 and is now in nearby Ewing; other colleges include Rider University (1865) in nearby Lawrenceville and Mercer County Community College (1966).

They have always engaged in farming (on the plains below) and pottery making. Believed to be the oldest continuously inhabited place in the area of the United States (since the 10th century), it was described by the conquistador Francisco Vázquez de Coronado in 1540 as the strongest defensive position in the world. The massive mission church of San Esteban del Rey was built there in 1629–41; its 30-foot (9-metre) log beams were carried from the Cebollita Mountains (30 miles [50 km] southwest) and, with the dirt for its graveyard, were hauled up from below. Visitors and inhabitants can now gain access by means of a staircase cut into the rock, and a road that bears vehicular traffic has also been built. The pueblo’s name comes from the Keresan Indian language: ako, meaning “white rock,” and ma, “people.” About 3 miles (5 km) northeast is the Enchanted Mesa, another butte rising 430 feet (130 metres) above the surrounding plain, which is believed by the Acoma Indians to be the dwelling place of their gods.

The area was the site of Native American pueblos (villages) when Europeans first arrived in 1540. Founded in 1706 by Don Francisco Cuervo y Valdés, governor and captain general of New Mexico, it was named for the duke of Alburquerque, then viceroy of New Spain (the first r was later dropped). It became an important trading centre on the Chihuahua Trail from Mexico.[P1]The mission church of San Felipe de Neri, Albuquerque, N.M.W. Hearne/Shostal AssociatesAlbuquerque, N.M.© Zack Frank/Shutterstock.comAlbuquerque, N.M.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML1]As a modern-day cultural and political centre, Albuquerque has long played a secondary role to the state capital, Santa Fe, which lies some 60 miles (100 km) to the northeast. Albuquerque is New Mexico’s largest city and its economic capital, however, and it is served by an extensive network of railroads, airlines, and highways. At the heart of the city’s economy are the military and high-technology sectors. Area 181 square miles (469 square km). Pop. (2000) 448,607; Albuquerque Metro Area, 729,649; (2010) 545,852; Albuquerque Metro Area, 887,077.[P2] Character of the city Enclosed by mountains, the Rio Grande, lava cliffs, military bases, and Native American pueblos, Albuquerque seemingly has reached its physical limits, barring expansion into adjacent valleys. Much of the city is made up of suburban developments. Older neighbourhoods line the banks of the broad Rio Grande, with Spanish-style adobe homes nestled among galleries of tall cottonwood and oak trees; they are artifacts of another age, however. Critics complain that Albuquerque is losing its distinctive identity in the face of centrifugal growth, a process that began in the mid-1940s with the city’s rise as a centre of Cold War-related military research and production. Despite an increase in the crime rate and urban sprawl, the city continues to attract new residents, who are enticed by a lower cost of living than that of much of the United States as well as by the region’s pleasant climate. As new residents arrive, longer-established inhabitants press for the preservation of the city’s distinctive historic architecture and small-town way of life.[P3]A newer adobe home in Albuquerque, N.M.© PhotoBeard/Shutterstock.comOlder southwestern-style home in Albuquerque, N.M.© George Michael Warnock/Shutterstock.com[ML3] [H3]Landscape City site Albuquerque lies in the Chihuahuan Desert, in a broad valley that stretches about 30 miles (48 km) east-west. The valley is bounded for most of its length by the Sandia Mountains to the north, the slightly lower Manzano Mountains to the east, and the low but rugged lava escarpments to the south and west. The Rio Grande bisects the western end of the valley, and a highway follows the river’s course through the city southward to the Texas border. To the west of the Rio Grande is a lava field and a cluster of dormant volcanoes. At the eastern end of the valley lies Tijeras Canyon, a rugged, boulder-strewn gorge that opens onto a broad plateau; a multilane highway passes through the canyon. The entire region is part of the tectonic Rio Grande rift valley, and minor earthquakes are common.[P4]Sandia Mountains, New Mexico.G. Thomas[ML4] Most of the city proper lies on hilly terraces composed of gravels from the Miocene (about 23 million to 5.3 million years ago) and Pliocene (about 5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago) epochs. These terraces were formed over millennia by soils and rocks washing down from the nearby Sandia and Manzano mountains and deposited by periodic floods. Rich in nutrients, these soils have provided the basis for the region’s long tradition of floodplain agriculture.[P5] Climate Albuquerque’s climate is mild and dry, with an annual average of more than 200 clear days. The average annual temperature is in the mid-50s F (about 13 °C). The Manzano Mountains to the east block much of the moisture-laden air that flows northward from the Gulf of Mexico, creating a rain shadow. As a result, the city receives only about 9 inches (230 mm) of rainfall annually, most of it falling in the summer. The Sandia Mountains receive about 30 inches (760 mm) of rain in the summer and about the same amount of snow in the winter.[P6] City layout Suburbs and satellite communities have grown rapidly while the heart of the original city—the 18th-century Old Town and the 19th-century Downtown—long languished, despite the government’s attempt to attract attention to these historic districts with new civic plazas, museums, and parks. In the early 21st century, however, Downtown again became attractive, especially to faculty from the University of New Mexico and students and artists. Like many cities in the western United States, Albuquerque has several widespread centres in place of a single downtown core.[P7]San Felipe de Neri Church, Albuquerque, N.M.© Solaria/Shutterstock.comPlaza Vieja in Old Town, Albuquerque, N.M.www.itsatrip.org[ML7] The Uptown district, to the north of Old Town, boasts shopping centres, hotels, and office and industrial parks. The downtown area south of Old Town comprises government buildings, hospitals, and museums. To the east of Old Town is the home of the University of New Mexico as well as a number of attractive, tree-lined neighbourhoods. Extending from Uptown to the foothills of the Sandia Mountains is Far Heights, mainly a sprawl of suburban homes, retail giants, and restaurants. Beyond the city proper to the north and south, respectively, lie the North Valley and the South Valley, which comprise several old farming settlements; both areas are largely Hispanic and industrial or agricultural in character. To the far northwest of Old Town lies Rio Rancho, an independent entity that was a retirement centre but is now a small upscale city.[P8] [H4]People Because Albuquerque was a distant outpost of the Spanish empire, its residents were mostly of Hispanic or mixed Hispanic–Native American ancestry until the late 19th century. Influxes of Protestant settlers (generally of northern European descent) throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries reduced the predominantly Roman Catholic Hispanic population to a minority by the late 1880s. Nevertheless, in the early 21st century more than two-fifths of Albuquerque’s residents were of Hispanic origin. The core of this population was made up of descendants of families who came to New Mexico during the long period of Spanish rule (before Mexico became independent). Calling themselves Hispanos, they distinguish themselves from other Latinos, especially those who have more recently arrived from Mexico and who are locally referred to as Chicanos or Mexicans. Members of the older Hispano families remain prominent in city politics.[P9] The majority of the remainder of the population consists of descendants of Europeans (about two-fifths). The city has a small population of Native Americans, many of whom arrived as university students from the Apache and Navajo reservations of Arizona and New Mexico and remained in the city to work after graduating. Most of the area’s American Indians, however, live in independent pueblos to the north and south of the city; all but a few of Albuquerque’s pueblos lie within an hour’s drive of Downtown. Albuquerque also has a growing community of South and Southeast Asians, many of whom began to work in the high-technology and service sectors in the mid-1970s.[P10] Albuquerque’s recent pattern of growth, with suburbs expanding farther from the city centre, has created de facto segregation in housing. Members of ethnic minorities are concentrated in older sections of the city along the Rio Grande, and those of the “white” majority tend to reside in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains.[P11] [H5]Economy For hundreds of years before and after the arrival of the Spanish, the basis of Albuquerque’s economy was agricultural, and small farms and large cattle ranches surrounded the pueblos and Old Town. During Spanish rule, Albuquerque served as a shipping point for metal ores and timber brought in from nearby mines and mills, though the city’s distance from Mexico kept Albuquerque from gaining economic importance outside the region. After the arrival of transcontinental rail lines in the early 1880s, however, Albuquerque became an important distribution centre for imported and locally produced goods. Since the mid-20th century, agriculture has been of relatively little economic importance to the city, and only a few ranches still operate. Albuquerque’s modern economy is based on light manufacturing, services, and research and development.[P12] Manufacturing Present-day Albuquerque serves as a transportation centre for commerce and industry. Manufactures include electronics, lumber, machinery, and foodstuffs. By the early 1990s, several high-technology firms had established plants for the manufacture of semiconductors and other computer components.[P13] Finance and other services Sandia National Laboratories, an assemblage of government laboratories and offices, military installations, and other manufacturing firms, and the University of New Mexico are the city’s largest employers. However, most of Albuquerque’s workforce is employed in service jobs, particularly in restaurants, hotels, and retail shops. In the late 1990s the average income of city dwellers was the second lowest in the Southwest, and unemployment and underemployment were prevalent, particularly in the predominantly Hispanic South Valley. Conditions improved in the following decade, with Albuquerque’s economy generally resembling those of other southwestern cities.[P14]Shops in Old Town, Albuquerque, N.M.www.itsatrip.org[ML14] Tourism is an important adjunct to the economy. Old Town, the original Spanish settlement, draws many visitors. The Sandia Peak Ski Area, with an aerial tramway, is a few miles northeast.[P15]Sandia Peak Aerial Tramway, Albuquerque, N.M.Jay BlackwoodSandia Peak, Albuquerque, N.M.Michael Hayes[ML15] Transportation By virtue of its location along the Rio Grande, running north-south, and across level uplands leading to the mountains to the east and west, Albuquerque has long been a transportation centre. Beginning in the 19th century, several railroad lines ran through the city, which today is served by the Union Pacific and Amtrak. Two major interstate highways pass through the city, intersecting in the heart of Downtown. Both highways, as well as local arterials, are regularly congested; alternatives to relieve some of the crowding in the city itself (such as light rail service and streetcars) have been discussed by city officials. A short-run commuter railroad runs along the main interstate corridor from the northern town of Bernalillo to the outlier southern town of Belen through downtown Albuquerque. Albuquerque International Airport is among the busiest in the western United States, with direct flights to domestic cities and connections to numerous international destinations.[P16]Interstate bypasses, Albuquerque, N.M.© Zack Frank/Shutterstock.com[ML16] [H6]Administration and society Government and municipal services Albuquerque is governed by a mayor and a nine-member city council. Like many cities in the West, the elected council’s power is secondary to that of the appointed city manager, whose office controls the budget and most day-to-day governmental operations. The city provides waste-collection services, police and fire protection, and the maintenance of a network of municipal parks.[P17] Health Albuquerque enjoys a long tradition of excellent health care, with several modern private and public hospitals, a legacy of both the military presence in the area and the city’s role as a convalescent centre during the nationwide tuberculosis epidemic in the early 20th century. In addition to private and public facilities, both the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Indian Health Service operate clinics and hospitals in Albuquerque.[P18] Education Albuquerque boasts several fine private schools and the state’s principal higher educational institution, the University of New Mexico (1889). The city is also the site of the Albuquerque Technical-Vocational Institute. At the beginning of the 21st century, however, Albuquerque’s public education system suffered from overcrowding and a lack of funding.[P19]The Alumni Memorial Chapel at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque.Photos.com/Jupiterimages[ML19] [H7]Cultural life As a cultural centre, Albuquerque has long been overshadowed by its northern neighbour, Santa Fe, with its carefully preserved historic architecture and thriving arts district. Since the 1990s, however, Nob Hill, the area along Central Avenue (old Route 66) east of the University of New Mexico campus, has grown to become the heart of Albuquerque’s culture and nightlife. Restaurants, art galleries, theatres, and cinemas are plentiful, as are bookstores that sometimes feature readings and appearances by well-known local writers such as novelists Tony Hillerman and Rudolfo A.

When Spanish explorers under conquistador Francisco Vásquez de Coronado entered the area in 1540, the Tiwa people were living in pueblos along the Rio Grande and its tributary streams, cultivating extensive gardens in the river’s floodplain. Distance from other settlements had not kept the Tiwa from participating in a trade network that extended as far east as the Great Plains and as far south as Mexico. Coronado’s expedition used one pueblo, Kuaua (preserved as the Coronado State Monument), as a base of operations from 1540 to 1541, sending scouting parties deep into present-day Kansas in its quest for the Seven Golden Cities of Cíbola.[P23]Stone ruins of a Native American settlement, Albuquerque, N.M.© Jeffrey M. Frank/Shutterstock.com[ML23] Spanish and Mexican rule In 1610 the Spanish government established the provincial capital of New Mexico at Santa Fe, some 60 miles (100 km) northeast of present-day Albuquerque. The capital and other Spanish centres were abandoned following the violent Pueblo Rebellion of 1680. After the reconquest of 1692, the Spanish governors wanted to establish a stronger military presence in the region. In 1706 provincial governor Don Francisco Cuervo y Valdés ordered that a Spanish garrison (the future Albuquerque) be established near the Tiwa pueblos. By Spanish law, to gain recognition as a village, the new settlement was required to have a population of 30 Spanish families. Only 18 families came to the area with the first group of settlers, but Cuervo y Valdés managed to entice others by providing military protection and by constructing a small, pleasant town that became known for its cleanliness and orderliness, as well as its mission church, San Felipe de Neri. In the next century, a growing Spanish population joined the Tiwa people who were spread across the valley. Albuquerque grew from a few dozen adobe houses and pueblos to several hundred sturdy structures, nourished by an extensive system of acequias, or irrigation canals.[P24] In 1806 Spanish soldiers intercepted an American exploring party led by U.S. Army Lt. Zebulon Montgomery Pike, who was then surveying the newly acquired lands of the Louisiana Purchase. Pike protested that he did not know that he was in Spanish territory, and the Spanish governor released him and escorted him to the border. Pike returned to Washington with a report that praised Albuquerque and Santa Fe. His report encouraged the arrival of American traders, buffalo hunters, and travelers in Albuquerque, many of whom followed the Santa Fe Trail.[P25]Portrait of Zebulon Pike, oil on canvas by Charles Willson Peale, 1808; in Independence National Historical Park, Philadelphia.Courtesy of the Independence National Historical Park Collection, Philadelphia[ML25] By 1820 Anglo-American settlers had become a regular presence in the Albuquerque area, a cause of concern for the Spanish government. When Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, New Mexico came under Mexican rule. During the Mexican-American War (1846–48), American troops under Gen. Stephen Watts Kearny occupied Albuquerque and encountered no resistance. Most of Kearny’s troops moved on to California, but he left a small garrison to protect the area. At the end of the war, after defeating Mexico, the American government made New Mexico an official U.S. territory in 1850. Santa Fe remained the territorial capital, and a fort was established in Albuquerque.[P26] Growth of Albuquerque Albuquerque’s fort and federal garrison came under attack at the outbreak of the American Civil War, when the territory suffered minor Confederate cavalry raids. In the winter of 1862, Confederate soldiers led by Gen. H.H. Sibley captured the town and held it until March, when Union forces arrived. In the years following the war, New Mexico Territory experienced the rise of an important livestock industry, with cattle ranchers and sheepherders bringing livestock and other animals into the area. Faced with the need to drive their herds hundreds of miles overland to market, the livestock producers lobbied for a freight railroad in the 1870s. Several regional lines finally extended to the city by 1880.[P27] Albuquerque’s Old Town had lost importance by the late 19th century, when the railroad depot was built 2 miles (3 km) away, closer to the city’s present government centre. In the following years, Albuquerque appeared to be two cities in one—the Spanish Old Town, with its small buildings and winding lanes, and a sprawling American city.[P28] Albuquerque became a major regional transportation centre, with rail lines serving as important instruments of economic growth. The territory’s population grew with the arrival of workers and immigrants, and Albuquerque was incorporated as a town in 1885. By 1891 the town had become a city. By 1918 thousands of “health seekers”—mostly victims of tuberculosis and other pulmonary diseases—had flocked to Albuquerque, which was served by several hospitals built by the federal government.[P29] Newcomers to Albuquerque soon displaced the hidalgos, or noblemen, of the Spanish past to form a mostly “white” business elite, made up of merchants, bankers, and ranchers. With the rise of this new elite by the start of World War I, Albuquerque emerged as a conservative, Republican-dominated political centre that exercised broad influence on both New Mexico and the neighbouring regions of eastern Arizona and western Texas. Among the first acts of the new Republican majority was the institution of the city manager form of government in 1917, an innovation that broke the power of the predominantly Democratic ward bosses and their Hispanic constituencies.[P30] The U.S. government’s presence increased in the 1930s, when more than a hundred federal agencies established offices in the city. The federal mark on the city grew even stronger after World War II, when the government chose Albuquerque as the site for the Sandia Complex (now Sandia National Laboratories), a diverse group of industrial facilities, military bases, laboratories, and offices, which earned the city the nickname “Little Washington.” Kirtland Air Force Base, established in 1942 as Kirtland Army Air Field, developed as an important testing ground for various weapons (some nuclear), while Albuquerque became a processing centre for stores of uranium mined on the nearby Colorado Plateau. During the Cold War period, Albuquerque was considered a strike target in the event of nuclear war with the Soviet Union.[P31] The contemporary city At the end of the Cold War, Albuquerque’s economy began to diversify, especially in the development of solar energy systems and computer equipment. Even so, it remains heavily dependent on federal and military expenditures. The city’s explosive postwar growth—from a population of 35,449 in 1940 to more than 500,000 by the turn of the 21st century—mirrored that of the entire Southwest, and it did not slow down in the first decade of the 21st century.[P32] Gregory Lewis McNamee [END-OF-CONTENT]

A dry, invigorating climate makes it a popular summer resort, while mountain skiing attracts winter visitors.[P1]State Capitol, Santa Fe, New Mexico.Dick Kent[ML1]Founded in 1610 by Governor Don Pedro de Peralta, it was named Villa Real de la Santa Fé de San Francisco de Asis (Spanish: “Royal City of the Holy Faith of St. Francis of Assisi”) and developed around a central plaza. Evacuated in 1680 after the Pueblo Rebellion, it was retaken peacefully in 1692 by Don Diego de Vargas, an event commemorated by an annual fiesta.[P2]During the 18th century Santa Fe served as the administrative, military, and missionary headquarters of a vast, sparsely populated Spanish colonial frontier province. U.S. interest in the area was aroused by the report of Lieutenant Zebulon M. Pike, who was imprisoned there during his exploration of the Southwest in 1806. After Mexican independence (1821), a brisk wagon-train commerce developed over the Santa Fe Trail. During the Mexican War the city was occupied (1846) by U.S. forces under General Stephen Watts Kearny, and an English-language newspaper was published there in 1847. After New Mexico was ceded to the United States (1848), Santa Fe became the capital in 1851 of the Territory of New Mexico and, in 1912, of the state. In 1862 the city was occupied for two weeks by Confederate forces under General H.H. Sibley. The railroad arrived in 1880, and there were brief mining booms in the nearby mountains, but the city essentially remained a trading centre for ranchers, farmers, and Indians.[P3]Construction in the early 1940s of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (later Los Alamos National Laboratory) for atomic research, 35 miles (56 km) northwest, brought new economic vitality to the area.[P4]The Palace of the Governors (built by Peralta in 1610) was restored as a museum in 1914.

During the American Civil War the town harboured a federal garrison and served as a supply centre. The settlement’s growth was encouraged by the discovery of silver in 1867, the arrival of the Santa Fe Railway in 1880 (at which time Socorro was the largest city in New Mexico), and the founding in 1889 of the New Mexico School of Mines (now New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology). Mining, ranching, and irrigated agriculture are basic to the economy. Socorro also serves as the supply point for the north end of the White Sands Missile Range. It has some light industries and is a tourist base for a scenic mountain region including part of the Cibola National Forest. The nearby Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, which provides habitat for more than 700 bird, mammal, and reptile species, is a popular destination for visitors. Inc. 1894. Pop.

New Mexico"Taos"Town"Taos county"north-northeast of Santa Fe"Taos, town, seat of Taos county, New Mexico, U.S. It lies on a branch of the Rio Grande in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, near Wheeler Peak, the highest point in New Mexico, 55 miles (89 km) north-northeast of Santa Fe. The name comes from the Spanish rendering of Tiwa, the name of the indigenous Pueblo people. An early Spanish settlement, Taos was the scene of the so-called Pueblo Rebellion (1680) against Spain. The Taos Trail was a branch of the Santa Fe Trail, and the town became an important trading centre. In 1847 Charles Bent, the U.S. civil governor of the province of New Mexico, was killed in Taos during an Indian uprising.[P1]Taos Pueblo, New Mexico, designated a World Heritage site in 1992.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML1]The community is a service centre for nearby ranches and actually consists of three villages: Don Fernando (also Fernandez) de Taos (known as Taos), the pueblo of San Geronimo (Taos Pueblo), and the Ranchos de Taos; Taos Pueblo’s adobe settlement was designated a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1992. With its picturesque adobe architecture, Taos was given impetus as a resort colony for writers and painters by Mabel Dodge Luhan, a wealthy patron of the arts whose home became a centre for visiting artists, such as Ansel Adams, Marsden Hartley, Alfred Stieglitz, and Georgia O’Keeffe. The novelist D.H. Lawrence lived outside Taos (1922–25), where he wrote his novel The Plumed Serpent (1926). His ranch is maintained by the University of New Mexico. The grave of the frontiersman-scout Kit Carson is the site of a memorial state park, and the house he occupied from 1853 to 1868 is preserved. Taos is the headquarters of Carson National Forest, and Taos Ski Valley is 19 miles (31 km) north-northwest.

The community itself was subsequently named Hot Springs and attained a reputation as a mineral spa. It also became a service point for the surrounding stock-raising, mining, and farming area. Its present place-name was adopted in 1951 when the city cooperated with radio (later television) personality Ralph Edwards, master of ceremonies of the quiz show called “Truth or Consequences,” in a promotion effort to hold a yearly program and fiesta there. The name change proved controversial, but the town’s citizens voted down repeated efforts to restore the name Hot Springs in the 1950s and ’60s.

Tucumcari is named for a mountain (1,000 feet [305 metres] above the plains), 1 mile (1.6 km) south; the name probably derives from the Comanche word tukumukaru, “to lie in wait for someone approaching,” and is rendered in early Spanish documents as Cuchuncari. The city’s growth as a trade centre and shipping point for cattle, cotton, wheat, and broomcorn was influenced by the completion of the Tucumcari Irrigation Project in 1940.

New York"Albany"City"Albany county"north of New York City"Albany, city, capital (1797) of the state of New York, U.S., and seat (1683) of Albany county. It lies along the Hudson River, 143 miles (230 km) north of New York City. The heart of a metropolitan area that includes Troy and Schenectady, it is a port city, the northern terminus of the deepwater Hudson River Channel, and a natural transshipment point between oceangoing vessels and the New York State Canal System routes to the Great Lakes.[P1]Albany, N.Y.Matt Wade[ML1]In 1609 the English explorer Henry Hudson anchored the Half-Moon in the shallows near the site while searching for the Northwest Passage. Fort Nassau, built in 1614 on Castle Island (now part of the Port of Albany), became a trading post for the New Netherland Company. A group of Walloon families built Fort Orange near the site in 1624 and began the first permanent settlement, known as Beverwyck. In 1629 the Dutch West India Company granted tracts along both sides of the river (including Beverwyck) to Kiliaen van Rensselaer, an Amsterdam merchant. Renamed Rensselaerswyck, the area attracted a sizable number of colonists, and in 1652 Peter Stuyvesant, colonial governor for the Dutch West India Company, obtained independent status for the village of Beverwyck from the van Rensselaer family. When Fort Orange surrendered to the British (September 24, 1664), the village was renamed to honour James, duke of York and Albany (later King James II). It was granted a city charter by the British governor Thomas Dongan on July 22, 1686. Albany’s strategic location and the construction of Fort Frederick made it a leading colonial city. Its population of 2,273 in 1703 increased to 3,498 in 1790 (the year of the first U.S. census) and to 50,763 by 1850. The Dutch heritage is reflected in many street names and in the annual Tulip Festival held in May in Washington Park.[P2]In 1689 one of the first intercolonial conventions was held at Albany to discuss a system of mutual defense. A more significant historical gathering was the Albany Congress, which took place in 1754. This meeting paved the way for the Congress of 1765 and the Continental Congress of 1774. Migrating pioneers began to appear in Albany as early as 1783, and the city, a thriving fur-trading centre, became a major outfitting point for wagon trains going west. The opening of the Erie Canal (1825) and the advent of the railroad (1831) increased the flow of traffic through the city, which became the hub of transportation to Michigan Territory (the upper Great Lakes).[P3]Politics remains a prevailing aspect of Albany. Its moderate industrial development includes the manufacture of paper, machine tools, clothing, industrial equipment, chemicals, electronics, and dental products. The city was one of the first in the country to establish a commercial airport (1919), and in 1932 the opening of the Port of Albany to oceangoing shipping made it a maritime centre.[P4]Aerial view of Albany, N.Y.Matt Wade[ML4]The city has notable examples of Dutch Colonial, Georgian, and French-Gothic Revival architecture, including the Schuyler Mansion (1761), Historic Cherry Hill (home of the van Rensselaer family; 1787), the State Bank of Albany (1803), the First Church in Albany (Old Dutch Church; 1797–99), City Hall (1881–83), the state capitol (1867–99) in “French Chateau” style, St. Peter’s Episcopal Church (1859), and the Joseph Henry Memorial (originally Albany Academy; completed 1817). The focal point of the city is the Governor Nelson A.

Settled by Albert Veeder in 1783, it was known as Veedersburg until it was renamed for Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1804. Its location on the Mohawk Trail, the completion of the Erie Canal (1825; now part of the New York State Canal System), and the arrival of the railroad (1836) stimulated its development. By 1838 textile mills had been set up along Chuctanunda Creek, a tributary of the Mohawk.[P1]The city’s once-dominant carpet and textile industries have to some extent given way to diversified manufactures, notably electronic equipment and toys. Fort Johnson, the home of pioneer and colonial administrator Sir William Johnson from 1749 to 1762, and nearby Guy Park, a stone mansion built in 1773 for Guy Johnson, nephew of Sir William, are now state historic sites. The National Shrine of the North American Martyrs (Saints René Goupil, Isaac Jogues, and Jean Lalande, who were massacred by Mohawk Indians) is at Auriesville, 6 miles (10 km) west.

It became a city when the 17th-century villages of Matteawan and Fishkill Landing were united in 1913. The name was inspired by the fires that blazed atop Mount Beacon during the American Revolution to warn George Washington of British troop movements; the mountain was later a resort, and the Mount Beacon Incline Railway (operated 1901–72) ascended its west spur (1,540 feet [469 metres] above the river). Industrialization began after the War of 1812 when businessman John Jacob Astor and others built a cotton mill and foundry.

Bedford Village, the original settlement, was founded in 1680 by 22 farmers from Stamford, Connecticut, on a tract known as the hop ground that was purchased from Katonah and other Wappinger Indian chiefs. Originally in Connecticut, the village was made part of New York in 1700 by royal boundary decree. During the American Revolution it was burned (1779) by British troops led by Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton. The town of Bedford, officially established in 1682, includes the hamlets of Bedford Village, Bedford Hills, and Katonah. The building of reservoirs for New York City forced the removal of Katonah to its present site (1897), changed the town’s landscape, and stimulated a residential trend.

It was there on the banks of the Niagara River that the explorer René-Robert Cavelier, sieur (lord) de La Salle, built his ship the Griffon in 1679. A French trading post under Chabert Joncaire was established in 1758 but was abandoned the following year after it was burned by the British. Seneca Indians under British protection settled the area in 1780. The town was laid out in 1803–04 by Joseph Ellicott of the Holland Land Company. Named New Amsterdam (but popularly called Buffalo), it had a population of about 1,500 at the time of the War of 1812 and became the American military headquarters for operations on the Niagara frontier. It was again burned by the British in 1813 but was rebuilt and incorporated as the village of Buffalo in 1816. The origin of the place-name is in dispute, as buffalo (bison) did not inhabit the area; it may reflect a mispronunciation of the French beau fleuve (“beautiful river”), in reference to the local Buffalo Creek.[P2]Map of Buffalo, N.Y., and the Niagara Frontier c. 1900 from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML2] The first steamboat on the upper Great Lakes, Walk-on-the-Water, was built at Buffalo in 1818. The completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 brought a tremendous economic boom to the community, attracting immigrants and boosting its population to some 10,000 at the time of its incorporation as a city in 1832. Trade with the expanding West grew rapidly during the American Civil War period. Railroads, attracted by existing markets and trade routes, converged on the city. Shipyards, iron and steel mills, meat-packing plants, flour mills, and railroad car industries developed. The harnessing of Niagara waterpower in the 1890s further stimulated the growth of highly diversified industry.[P3] Buffalo was the home of two U.S. presidents: Millard Fillmore and Grover Cleveland, who was elected mayor in 1881. President William McKinley was assassinated in the city while visiting the Pan-American Exposition (1901). The Ansley Wilcox Mansion, where Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office following the assassination, was dedicated a national historic site in 1966. Niagara Square, dominated by the McKinley Monument and site of the City Hall (1932) and federal buildings, is the focus of the city.[P4]The Ansley Wilcox Mansion, in the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site, Buffalo, New York, U.S.Milt and Joan Mann/CameraMann International[ML4] [H3]The contemporary city The chief manufactures include auto parts, chemicals, plastics, medical supplies, machine tools, pharmaceuticals, and wood products. However, services (notably those related to trade and government employment) constitute the largest share of the city’s economy. Buffalo is a major port of the St. Lawrence Seaway; it is the terminus of the New York State Canal System and is a major rail centre and highway crossroads. As the main U.S. gateway to the Toronto-Hamilton industrial region of Ontario, it processes a large percentage of trade between the United States and Canada. The international Peace Bridge to Fort Erie, Ontario, was opened in 1927 as a memorial to 100 years of peaceful relations between the United States and Canada.[P5] The State University of New York at Buffalo (University at Buffalo) was founded in 1846, and the State University College at Buffalo (Buffalo State College) originated in 1867. Colleges in the city and suburbs include Canisius (1870), Medaille (1875; chartered 1937), D’Youville (1908), Erie Community (1946), Daemen (1947), Trocaire (1958), and Villa Maria (1960). Buffalo is also an established centre for medical research. Cultural institutions include the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society, the Buffalo Museum of Science, Kleinhans Music Hall (home of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra), Shea’s Performing Arts Center (in a renovated theatre built in 1926), and Studio Arena (a professional theatre founded in 1965).[P6] Ralph Wilson Stadium is the home of the Buffalo Bills (professional American gridiron football team), and the First Niagara Center houses the Sabres professional ice hockey team.

New York"Chautauqua"Town"Chautauqua county"western New York"Chautauqua, resort-colony and town (township), Chautauqua county, western New York, U.S. The resort-colony lies on Chautauqua Lake (18 miles [29 km] long, 1–2 miles [1.5–3 km] wide), near Lake Erie, 16 miles (26 km) northwest of Jamestown. It originated in 1874 with the establishment of the Chautauqua Institution, a lyceum and amusement series popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that was started by John Heyl Vincent as an attempt to educate Methodist Sunday-school teachers. The institution gave rise to the Chautauqua movement, in which similar programs were established throughout the United States. Though the movement has died out and the popularity of the original series itself has greatly diminished, the institution remains the centre of a resort area with a summer program of cultural pursuits (including art, drama, music, and religion) and youth activities.

Originally part of the Holland Land Purchase and the town of Amherst, the site was first settled in 1808 by Appollos Hitchcock, who was appointed Indian agent for the Buffalo Reservation. The town, incorporated in 1839, derived its name from an Iroquoian word, ji-ik-do-wah-gah (“place of the crab apple tree”). There was some fleeting land speculation when the railroads came through after the American Civil War. Rapid residential, industrial, and commercial growth occurred after World War II.

Formerly an island, it was known to Dutch settlers as Konijn Eiland (“Rabbit Island”), which was presumably Anglicized as Coney Island. It became part of Long Island after Coney Island Creek silted up to form a sandbar (about 5 miles [8 km] long and 0.25–1 mile [0.4–1.6 km] wide) between Gravesend Bay (north), Sheepshead Bay (east), and Lower Bay (south).[P1]Coney Island: Luna ParkLuna Park, Coney Island, 1903.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.Coney IslandConey Island, Brooklyn, New York City.Bran[ML1]Coney Island developed into an amusement area at the turn of the 20th century. The coming of the subway in 1920 greatly enhanced its accessibility and further boosted its popularity. Coney Island became one of the best-known amusement parks in the United States, with its 3.5-mile (5.6-km) Boardwalk fronted by a sand beach. Numerous concessions were developed with rides, exhibitions, restaurants, and souvenir shops. The amusement areas began to decline after World War II, and only a fraction of the attractions remained by the early 21st century. The Sea Gate district at Coney Island’s western end is a residential section, and a large housing project occupies the site of Luna Park (closed 1946), one of the area’s earliest amusement parks.

Putnam Creek, named for the American Revolutionary War general Israel Putnam, flows through the town, which includes the hamlets of Crown Point, Crown Point Center, and Ironville. In 1609 the French explorer Samuel de Champlain fought Indians of the Iroquois Confederacy there and began the enmity between the Iroquois and the French. Dutch and English traders later traveled in the vicinity. In 1731 the French constructed a stone fort (Fort-Saint-Frédéric) on the peninsula, which they called Point à la Couronne (Crown Point). Despite English-colonial expeditions sent against it, Crown Point remained in French hands until 1759, when it was occupied by forces commanded by Sir Jeffrey (later Lord) Amherst. He began the construction near Fort-Saint-Frédéric of a larger fort, which was garrisoned but never completed. At the outbreak of the American Revolution the fort was captured by Colonel Seth Warner and a force of Green Mountain Boys. It remained in American hands except for a brief period in 1777 when it was occupied by a detachment of General John Burgoyne’s invading British army. The ruined forts now constitute a state historic site.

During the American Revolution, George Washington, retreating from Long Island, regrouped his forces and fought the delaying Battle of Harlem Heights (September 16, 1776) just west of modern Harlem between 103rd and 120th streets. Through the 18th century Harlem was a farming and pastoral area. In the 19th century it became a fashionable residential district with many houses used as summer retreats. Apartment houses arose during the building boom of the 1880s. High rates of vacancy in the years following the panic of 1893 led property owners to rent to blacks, especially along Lenox Avenue, and by World War I much of Harlem was firmly established as a black residential and commercial area. The chief artery of black Harlem is 125th Street, popularly called “the Main Stem.”[P2]After World War I Harlem became the centre of the creative literary development called the “Harlem Renaissance.” Such figures as the poets Countee Cullen, James Weldon Johnson, Alain Locke, and Claude McKay were leaders of this new realism. An important anthology of writings of this movement is Locke’s The New Negro (1925). As the neighbourhoods surrounding Harlem resisted expansion of its growing black population, residential overcrowding increased. At the same time, the aging dwellings there received only minimal maintenance—many were abandoned by their owners when the cost of rehabilitation and compliance with city housing codes became high. This still-continuing vicious circle, aggravated by high rates of unemployment and residential mobility, has caused severe deterioration of the neighbourhood. By the 1980s private community organizations and the city administration had taken measures to arrest these trends and their attendant social maladjustments. Public housing, new approaches in community-controlled schools, and better medical facilities were important developments.[P3]The Cotton Club, Harlem, New York City, c. 1930.Frank Driggs Collection/Hulton Archive/Getty Images[ML3]The term Harlem was often used inaccurately as a synonym for New York’s black community. In fact, by the 1970s the black population had expanded beyond this area to other parts of Manhattan and to large parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn. In the early 21st century blacks constituted some 40 percent of the population of Harlem, and the dual pressures of gentrification and new waves of immigration contributed to further decline in the proportion. New York City’s large Puerto Rican population historically had its principal centre in eastern Harlem, along Park Avenue from 96th Street northward, in an area known pejoratively as “Spanish Harlem.” By 2010, however, the Hispanic community was concentrated in central Harlem, and east Harlem’s overall population numbers stood at roughly half of their 1950 peak. The late 2000s also saw an increase in the number of Harlem’s white non-Hispanic residents, a demographic shift by which whites constituted a larger percentage of Harlem’s population than they had at any time since 1940. One of the remnants of that early era of integration, “Italian Harlem,” persisted as a small enclave along First Avenue and Pleasant Avenue, with an axis along 116th Street.[P4] [END-OF-CONTENT]
New York"Hempstead"Town"Nassau county"Situated in the west-central part of Long Island"Hempstead, town (township), Nassau county, New York, U.S. Situated in the west-central part of Long Island, it comprises 22 incorporated villages and 34 unincorporated communities. The city of Long Beach fronts the Atlantic Ocean just south of Hempstead town. The land tract was purchased from the Delaware Indians in 1643 by John Carman and the Reverend Robert Fordham, two English settlers from Stamford, Connecticut, and the original settlement (now Hempstead village) was named for Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, England. The town was part of Queens county from 1683 until 1899, when Nassau county was established. After the American Revolution, opposing sympathies led to its division into North Hempstead and South Hempstead. The latter was renamed Hempstead in 1801.[P1]HempsteadThe Old Town Hall, Hempstead, N.Y.Meadowbrook[ML1]The town is dotted with colonial landmarks, including Cooper Field (where the Duke’s Laws Convention of 1665 was held); St. George’s Church (chartered by George II in 1735; rebuilt 1822) and Christ’s First Presbyterian Church (1644; rebuilt 1846) in Hempstead village; the George Hewlett House (c. 1660) on East Rockaway Road; and Rock Hall (1767) in Lawrence. Hempstead’s rural character changed after the introduction of the trolley car in the early 1900s and the arrival of the Long Island Rail Road. Hofstra University was founded in Hempstead village in 1935. There was rapid urban development after World War II; manufactures became well diversified, and industrial parks were developed at Roosevelt Field (now the site of a shopping centre) and Inwood.[P2]Mitchel Field, near Garden City, has played a significant role in the town’s development since the War of 1812; it served as an army training ground until World War II, when it became an air base (closed 1961). Hempstead Plain, surrounding Garden City and Roosevelt Field, became a centre of pioneer aviation activity; it was there that Glenn Curtiss demonstrated his June Bug airplane (1908), Charles A. Lindbergh began his solo flight to Paris (1927), and James Doolittle made the first “blind” flight (1929). Mitchel Field and Hempstead Plain are now built-up areas.[P3]The Nassau County Charter of 1936 preserved the rights of existing incorporated villages but denied unincorporated communities the right to incorporate. Larger villages (some of which overlap with North Hempstead) are Valley Stream (incorporated 1925), Rockville Centre (1893; seat of Molloy College [founded 1955]), Floral Park (1908), Freeport (1892), Garden City (1919), Hempstead village (1853), and Lynbrook (1911). Unincorporated communities include Baldwin, Uniondale, Levittown, Roosevelt, Merrick, Elmont, Franklin Square, East Meadow, Oceanside, and Wantagh. Sports events are held at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, and Belmont Park is renowned for its Thoroughbred horse racing—especially the annual Belmont Stakes.

 New York"Herkimer"Village""his nearby home is a state historic site"Herkimer, county, central New York state, U.S. The northern arm of the county lies in the Adirondack Mountains, while the southern section consists of a hilly upland. The principal streams are the Black, Independence, Mohawk, and Moose (north and south branches) rivers, as well as the New York State Canal System (completed 1918), which incorporates the Erie Canal (1825). Other bodies of water are Stillwater and Hinckley reservoirs and Honnedaga, Woodhull, and Fulton Chain lakes. The northern arm of the county is forested with the coniferous trees of Adirondack Park (1892)—one of the largest parks in the United States and the nation’s first forest preserve—while wooded areas in the south feature such hardwoods as maple, birch, and beech.[P1]Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML1]Oneida Indians, members of the Iroquois Confederacy, inhabited the region when settlers from different parts of America and Europe first arrived. The village of Herkimer, the county seat, was named for Nicholas Herkimer, who served the colonies as a general during the U.S. War of Independence and was fatally wounded in the Battle of Oriskany (August 6, 1777); his nearby home is a state historic site (1764). The murder trial of Chester Gillette in the Herkimer County Courthouse inspired the novel An American Tragedy (1925) by Theodore Dreiser. Beside the Erie Canal in Ilion, Eliphalet Remington built a firearms factory in 1828; his company supplied many of the weapons used by the U.S. government in the American Civil War and in World Wars I and II.[P2]The county was formed in 1791.

Settled in 1725 by Palatinate Germans, it was known successively as German Flats, Morgan’s Landing, and Remington’s Corners before incorporation as Ilion (for ancient Ilion, or Ilium [Troy]) in 1852. Completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 spurred its industrial growth. About the same time, Eliphalet Remington perfected the rifle, and his armoury, built in 1828 beside the canal, was the forerunner of a vast arms industry. The demand for Remington weapons supported the community and the surrounding villages.[P1]Production of firearms by the Remington Arms Company remains the main industry in Ilion; winter clothing is also manufactured there. Almost every type of firearm made by the company is displayed in the Remington Arms Museum. Remington Industries also introduced the first practical typewriter in 1873.

New York"Mount Vernon"City"Westchester county"Westchester county"Mount Vernon, city, Westchester county, New York, U.S., situated on the Bronx and Hutchinson rivers, just north of the Bronx, New York City. It was settled in 1664 near the site where religious dissenter Anne Hutchinson (banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony) was killed in 1643 by Indians. It became a farm village (considered part of Eastchester township), the meeting house of which was the scene of the election of Lewis Morris to the provincial assembly in 1733. Colonial governor William Cosby’s persistent opposition to Morris was reported by the antigovernment newspaper of John Peter Zenger, whose subsequent trial for seditious libel was the first major victory for the principle of freedom of the press in the American colonies. Mount Vernon was the scene of several battles during the American Revolution, including a delaying action by Glover’s Brigade on October 18, 1776, which probably saved General George Washington’s army from defeat by General William Howe. The village’s growth was assured when the Industrial Home Association, a cooperative group seeking relief from high New York City rents, purchased land for home sites there in the early 1850s and named the community for Washington’s home. Diversified industrial development includes the manufacture of jewelry, automatic fire sprinklers, and packaging materials.

New York City is in reality a collection of many neighbourhoods scattered among the city’s five boroughs—Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island—each exhibiting its own lifestyle. Moving from one city neighbourhood to the next may be like passing from one country to another. New York is the most populous and the most international city in the country. Its urban area extends into adjoining parts of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

No other city has contributed more images to the collective consciousness of Americans: Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous with theatre, Fifth Avenue is automatically paired with shopping, Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, Greenwich Village connotes bohemian lifestyles, Seventh Avenue signifies fashion, Tammany Hall defines machine politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, African American aspirations, and slums. The word tenement brings to mind both the miseries of urban life and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses. New York has more Jews than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin, more Italians than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than San Juan. Its symbol is the Statue of Liberty, but the metropolis is itself an icon, the arena in which Emma Lazarus’s “tempest-tost” people of every nation are transformed into Americans—and if they remain in the city, they become New Yorkers.[P2]New York CityTime-lapse video of New York City.Piotr Wancerz/Timelapse MediaNew York City: Tour of the cityA look at New York City in the 1980s, showing activity in the Garment District and views of the public transportation system and the urban landscape, including the twin towers of the World Trade Center, which were destroyed in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack.

More than half the people and goods that ever entered the United States came through its port, and that stream of commerce has made change a constant presence in city life. New York always meant possibility, for it was an urban centre on its way to something better, a metropolis too busy to be solicitous of those who stood in the way of progress. New York—while the most American of all the country’s cities—thus also achieved a reputation as both foreign and fearsome, a place where turmoil, arrogance, incivility, and cruelty tested the stamina of everyone who entered it. The city was inhabited by strangers, but they were, as James Fenimore Cooper explained, “essentially national in interest, position, pursuits. No one thinks of the place as belonging to a particular state but to the United States.” Once the capital of both its state and the country, New York surpassed such status to become a world city in both commerce and outlook, with the most famous skyline on earth. It also became a target for international terrorism—most notably the destruction in 2001 of the World Trade Center, which for three decades had been the most prominent symbol of the city’s global prowess. However, New York remains for its residents a conglomeration of local neighbourhoods that provide them with familiar cuisines, languages, and experiences. A city of stark contrasts and deep contradictions, New York is perhaps the most fitting representative of a diverse and powerful nation.[P3]bagelDiscover the chemistry of what makes the bagels in New York City distinctive.© American Chemical Society[ML3] [H3]The landscape The city site Sections of the granite bedrock of New York date to about 100 million years ago, but the topography of the present city is largely the product of the glacial recession that marked the end of the Wisconsin Glacial Stage about 10,000 years ago. Great erratic boulders in Manhattan’s Central Park, deep kettle depressions in Brooklyn and Queens, and the glacial moraine that remains in parts of the metropolitan area provide silent testimony to the enormous power of the ice. Glacial retreat also carved out the waterways around the city. The Hudson and East rivers, Spuyten Duyvil Creek, and Arthur Kill are, in reality, estuaries of the Atlantic Ocean, and the Hudson is tidal as far north as Troy. The approximately 600 miles (1,000 km) of New York shoreline are locked in constant combat with the ocean, as it erodes the land and adds new sediments elsewhere. Although the harbour is constantly dredged, ship channels are continually filled with river silt and are too shallow for more modern deep-sea vessels.[P4]New York City: Metropolitan areaNew York City metropolitan area.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.New York City: Central areaCentral New York City, depicting the borough of Manhattan southward from Central Park.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML4] South of the rockbound terrain of Manhattan stretches a sheltered, deepwater anchorage offering easy access to the Atlantic Ocean. In 1524 the Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to enter the harbour, which he named Santa Margarita, and he reported that the hills surrounding the vast expanse of New York Bay appeared to be rich in minerals; more than 90 species of precious stone and 170 of the world’s minerals have actually been found in New York. Verrazzano’s daring expedition was commemorated in 1964, when what was then the world’s longest suspension bridge was dedicated to span the Narrows at the entrance to Upper New York Bay.[P5] Only the third largest American port at the time of the American Revolution, New York gradually achieved trade domination and by the mid-1800s handled more than half of the country’s oceangoing travelers and commercial trade. After 1900 New York was the world’s busiest port, a distinction it held until the 1950s. Cargo containerization, the obsolescence of its waterfront piers, and soaring labour costs shifted business to the New Jersey side of the river after the 1960s, but at the beginning of the 21st century the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey still dominated the water trade of the northeastern United States.[P6] Page 1 of 9 Next page Climate and plant and animal life

North Hempstead separated from Hempstead in 1784. It remained agrarian during the 18th century, and an active shipping trade was conducted through its harbours and bays. Sands Point Lighthouse (1806) on Cow Neck remains a conspicuous landmark. Fine examples of colonial mills survive at Plandome, Roslyn, and Saddle Rock.[P2]Urban development was fostered by the Long Island Rail Road, which reached Mineola (1837), Roslyn (1864), and Port Washington (1898). Millionaires built large estates in the area, such as that of Clarence Hungerford Mackay at Roslyn and those of Henry C. Phipps and Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney at Old Westbury. Many writers became residents of the town. Cedarmere, home of the poet William Cullen Bryant, is preserved at Roslyn. Other notable residents included Frances Hodgson Burnett (at Plandome), F.

After the arrival of the Long Island Rail Road in 1836, followed by a trolley car line at the beginning of the 20th century, a number of large estates were built by financial and industrial tycoons. Oyster Bay gained fame through its most notable resident, President Theodore Roosevelt, whose three-story mansion “Sagamore Hill” (built 1880 at Cove Neck) became the summer White House (1901–09); it is now a national historic site. The Theodore Roosevelt Sanctuary (a bird sanctuary) and Trailside Museum are nearby, and Roosevelt’s grave is in the adjacent Young’s Memorial Cemetery.[P2]The town of Oyster Bay continued to be almost entirely rural-residential until it experienced a pre-World War II growth of the aircraft industry at Bethpage and Farmingdale. Oyster Bay now has a broad-based diversified economy with several planned industrial parks. Educational institutions in the town include the State University of New York College of Technology (established 1912) at Farmingdale, the State University of New York College (founded 1965) at Old Westbury, and the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University (1954) at Brookville.

New York"Palmyra"Town"Wayne county"western New York"Palmyra, town (township), Wayne county, western New York, U.S., on the New York State Canal System, 20 miles (32 km) east-southeast of Rochester. Founded in 1789 as a frontier town and named for the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra, the locale is associated with Joseph Smith, whose claims of visions there led to his founding the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Mormon Church) in 1830 at Fayette, 28 miles (45 km) southeast. Smith’s boyhood Palmyra home (restored) is near the Sacred Grove, where his first vision occurred in 1820. At nearby Hill Cumorah, as directed by the angel Moroni, he is said to have unearthed (1827) the Golden Plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon. A 40-foot (12-metre) monument to the angel crowns the hill, site of an annual Mormon pageant that takes place for seven nights beginning in late July. The village of Palmyra was separately incorporated in 1828. Dairy and vegetable farms are in the area and mechanical packings (sealing materials for pumps and valves) and paper boxes are manufactured. Area 34 square miles (87 square km). Pop.

It was founded by Zephaniah Platt in 1784. During the War of 1812, it was the scene of an important U.S. victory on Lake Champlain that saved New York from possible British invasion via the Hudson River valley. A British army of some 14,000 troops under Sir George Prevost reached Plattsburgh in a joint land and sea operation. U.S. defenders included 1,500 regulars and about 2,500 militia commanded by Gen. Alexander Macomb, supported by a 14-ship U.S. naval squadron under Commodore Thomas Macdonough. The outcome of the battle was determined on water when the British fleet was decisively defeated on Sept. 11, 1814. Deprived of naval support, the invading army was forced to retreat. The victory at Plattsburgh influenced the terms of peace drawn at the Treaty of Ghent the following December. The Macdonough Memorial commemorating the battle is in front of the city hall. The Kent-Delord House (1797) served successively as British and American headquarters and is maintained as a museum.[P1]Battle of Plattsburg, War of 1812England's troubles with Napoleon caused it to impress American merchant sailors for naval service against France. England was also pressing on America's western frontier. In response, America declared war on June 18, 1812. Thomas Macdonough was in command of the decisive American naval victory near Plattsburg on Lake Champlain.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML1]Abundant waterpower influenced the development of lumber and paper mills. Today Plattsburgh’s industries produce paper products (including wallpaper), toys, lighting fixtures, passenger railcars, and plastics, and the city is a base for the Lake Champlain resort area. The State University of New York College at Plattsburgh (established as a normal school, 1889) and Clinton Community College (1966) of the State University of New York system are additional economic factors. Recognized as a village in 1785, it was incorporated as a city in 1902. Pop. (2000) 18,816; (2010) 19,989.[P2] [END-OF-CONTENT]

It was settled by the Dutch in 1683; its name, of Wappinger Indian origin, means “reed-covered lodge by the little water place.” Poughkeepsie served as the temporary state capital, and the U.S. Constitution was ratified there in 1788. Its importance as a river grain port declined after completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, and the city became a manufacturing and commercial centre. The Smith Brothers (William and Andrew, the nationally advertised bearded “Trade” and “Mark”) made their first cough drops about 1850 in Poughkeepsie.

The first settlement there was made by the Dutch in 1636 near Flushing Bay, followed by the establishment of Newtown (1642), Far Rockaway (1644), Flushing (1645), and Jamaica (1656). These settlements came under English control in 1664, when Peter Stuyvesant surrendered to an English force acting for the duke of York. In 1683 Queens county was established as one of the 12 counties of the province of New York and was named to honour the queen consort of Charles II, Catherine of Braganza.[P1]New York City: Queens, c. 1900Queens (c. 1900), detail of a map of New York City from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML1]Queens was primarily rural during the 19th century, but some of its shore communities began attracting summer vacationists.

It is the centre of a metropolitan area that includes Greece, Irondequoit, Perinton, Henrietta, and Brighton (the largest towns [townships]); these, together with Gates, Chili, Pittsford, Penfield, and Webster, are mainly residential, although some have industrial parks.[P1]RochesterRochester, N.Y.Brian Stiehler[ML1]Settlement was made in 1789 at the falls of the Genesee, which powered a grist-mill built by Ebenezer Allen on a 100-acre (40-hectare) tract granted on condition that he would serve the needs of the Seneca Indians. The venture was a failure, and Allen’s land was sold to Colonel Nathaniel Rochester, Colonel William Fitzhugh, and Major Charles Carroll (all from Maryland). Rochester offered lots for sale in 1811, and in 1817 the village was incorporated as Rochesterville (shortened in 1822); it was incorporated as a city in 1834. The Erie Canal (1825) and the city’s abundant waterpower and railway linkages (1839) made it, by the 1850s, one of the early boom towns of the “West” (population 10,000) with a prosperous flour-milling industry based on the wheat production of the Genesee River valley. The clothing and shoe industries, initiated in the 1860s, were stimulated by demands of the American Civil War, and mass production methods were rapidly developed. After its flour millers moved west to Minnesota, the city turned to nursery enterprises and became a pioneer in the mail-order sale of seeds and shrubs.[P2]During the 1890s, industrialists such as George Eastman, John Jacob Bausch, and Henry Lomb developed photographic, optical, and precision equipment. Photocopy machines and other products including auto parts, machine tools, electrical equipment, clothing, plastics, and processed foods now augment the economy. Rochester is also the processing, distribution, and shipping point for the surrounding fertile truck- and fruit-farming belt. In 1916 the city was extended in a strip along both banks of the Genesee to Lake Ontario, and in 1931 the port of Rochester was developed to handle Great Lakes and ocean shipping.[P3]Map of Rochester, N.Y., c. 1900 from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML3]The city was the home of Margaret and Kate Fox, spiritualists who attracted world attention in the 1840s with a series of seances known as the Rochester rappings. In 1847 Frederick Douglass, the black abolitionist, published his antislavery paper (North Star) there. Rochester was also a terminus for the Underground Railroad (escape route for runaway slaves). Susan B. Anthony, the early woman suffragist, lived there from 1866 to 1906; her house is preserved, and she is buried in the city’s Mount Hope Cemetery.[P4]The city is the seat of the University of Rochester (founded in 1850, which includes the Eastman School of Music), the Rochester Institute of Technology (1829), and Roberts Wesleyan (1866), Nazareth (1924), and St. John Fisher (1948) colleges. The Monroe Community College of the State University of New York system was founded in 1961. The Colgate-Rochester Divinity School was founded in 1850 as the Rochester Theological Seminary. Cultural institutions include a symphony orchestra, an art gallery (University of Rochester), a planetarium, and the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House.

New York"Rome"City"Oneida county"east-central New York"Rome, city, Oneida county, east-central New York, U.S. It is situated 15 miles (24 km) northwest of Utica.[P1]The site, at the ancient Native American portage between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek, was fortified by the British as early as 1725. Fort Stanwix (1758), which replaced two previous forts there, was where two important treaties (1768, 1784) were negotiated between Native Americans and colonialists; the fort has been reconstructed as a national monument. The Battle of Oriskany (August 6, 1777) which stopped the British advance during the American Revolution, took place 6 miles (10 km) east of present-day Rome. Mapped in 1786 by Dominick Lynch and named Lynchville, the community was influenced in its early growth by the completion (1797) of a canal that connected the Mohawk River with Wood Creek. The construction of the Erie Canal (1817–25) was begun at Lynchville, and the settlement served as an embarkation point for pioneers moving west. The restored Erie Canal Village, 2.5 miles (4 km) west, commemorates these events. Lynchville was incorporated as a village in 1819 and was renamed Rome for the “heroic defense of the Republic made there”—i.e., at Oriskany. Rome was incorporated as a city in 1870.[P2]The community achieved industrial recognition as the “Copper City” through its manufacture of brass, wire, cable, and other products. Machinery industries (road graders, vacuum cleaners, air conditioners, radiators) developed later in Rome. Today’s industries produce medical and surgical equipment, copper roofing materials, and electrical wire. Truck and fruit farms, state developmental centres for the retarded and deaf, and a nearby industrial park, located at the former Griffiss Air Force Base, are additional economic factors.

Saratoga National Historic Park (established in 1938 and located 12 miles [19 km] southeast) commemorates the Revolutionary War Battles of Saratoga (September 19 and October 7, 1777) which took place nearby.[P1]The springs, long known to the Indians for their therapeutic value, attracted white visitors as early as 1771, and in 1802 the first hotel was built there by Gideon Putnam. During the 19th century Saratoga Springs became one of the most fashionable spas in the country, with ornate Victorian-style hotels. The Saratoga Association for the Improvement of the Breed of Horses was organized in 1863 and sponsored annual races in the city that continue to attract large crowds. The Saratoga Race Course in particular is noted for Thoroughbred racing. The city’s National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame contain mementos of great horses and riders of the past. In 1909, 122 springs were acquired by the state (their use regulated by law) after commercial exploitation (pumping and bottling) had greatly diminished their flow. Pools, bathhouses, and other buildings similar to those of European health spas were built on the land acquired by the state; opened to the public in 1935, these facilities became part of Saratoga Spa State Park in 1962. Skidmore College was founded in Saratoga Springs as an arts school in 1903, and the Empire State College of the State University of New York system opened in 1971.

With several smaller islands it forms Richmond county and the Staten Island borough of New York City. Roughly triangular, the island has about 35 miles (56 km) of waterfront and an area of almost 60 square miles (155 square km). It is connected with Manhattan by the Staten Island Ferry, which carries passengers and automobiles; with New Jersey by several bridges; and with Brooklyn by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The opening of the latter in 1964 spurred considerable development of the island.[P1]Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, New York City.Marvin Konerest/Comstock Inc.[ML1]Attempted European colonization of the island, which was occupied by Unami Indians of the Delaware tribe, began in 1630 by the Dutch. Indian attacks dispelled permanent settlers until 1661, when the Dutch West India Company granted lands to French Waldenses and Huguenots and a colony was established at Oude Dorp (“Old Town”), a few miles south of The Narrows (the channel separating the island from Brooklyn). The island was named for the Staten-Generaal (“States General”) of the Dutch Republic. Following the acquisition of New Netherland in 1664 by Great Britain, English and Welsh farmers established homes and farms on the island.[P2]New York City: Staten Island, c. 1900Staten Island (c. 1900), detail of a map of New York City from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML2]The Billopp, or Conference, House in Tottenville was the scene (September 11, 1776) of talks between representatives of the Continental Congress and the British in an unsuccessful attempt at reconciliation during the American Revolution.

The Jesuit missionary Father Simon Le Moyne in 1654 was the first European to note the site’s brine springs (later the basis of a salt industry). A mission and Fort Sainte Marie de Gannentaha were established nearby in 1655–56, but Indian hostility and the swampy location (notorious for summer fevers) precluded early settlement. Ephraim Webster established a trading post in 1786 at the mouth of Onondaga Creek where it enters Lake Onondaga, and in 1788 sawmills and gristmills were built at the site by Asa Danforth, “the father of Onondaga county.” A treaty with the Indians gave the state of New York control over the brine springs, and after 1797 the saltlands were leased for salt extraction. Three villages sprang up: Webster’s Landing, Salina, and Geddes. A post office, established at Webster’s Landing in 1820, was named Syracuse for the ancient Greek city in Sicily.[P2]The town’s growth was stimulated by construction of the Erie Canal (completed 1825) and the coming of the railroads in the 1830s. Syracuse later absorbed Salina (1848) and Geddes (1886). The saltworks supplied most of the United States’ needs until 1870, when the salt industry declined; the city then began to develop a diversified economy. Manufactures now include chinaware, pharmaceuticals, automotive components, electrical machinery, air conditioners, electronic equipment, funeral caskets, speciality metals, and furniture. Syracuse also serves as a wholesale distribution point for the central New York agricultural region.[P3]Syracuse is the home of Syracuse University (1870), Le Moyne College (1946), Onondaga Community College (1962) of the State University of New York system, the State University of New York Health Science Center (1834) and College of Environmental Science and Forestry (1911), and the Everson Museum of Art (1968). The New York State Fair has been held in Syracuse since 1841.[P4]The Onondaga Indian Reservation is 6 miles (10 km) south, and Onondaga Lake Park includes the Salt Museum and a replica of the Jesuit mission called Sainte Marie among the Iroquois.

The site was settled by the Dutch in the 17th century and developed after the American Revolution as a river port. The Hudson River Railroad arrived in 1849, and the village was incorporated in 1870. The opening of the Tappan Zee Bridge (1956) stimulated commercial growth, and in August 2017 the first span of its dramatic replacement—the two-span cable-stayed Governor Mario M.

Located on an ancient Indian portage, its name is derived from the Iroquois word cheonderoga meaning “between two waters,” or “where the waters meet.” The site, on the main route between Canada and the upper Hudson River valley, was of strategic importance to the French who built Fort-Carillon on Lake Champlain in 1755. Captured by the British in 1759 (during the French and Indian War) the fort was renamed Ticonderoga. During the American Revolution the Green Mountain Boys, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, overran the fort in a surprise attack on May 10, 1775, and seized artillery that Henry Knox transported to Boston for use against the British. It was retaken (1777) by the British under General John Burgoyne, who abandoned it after the Battles of Saratoga.

Its site was originally part of the Kiliaen van Rensselaer patroonship (estate) granted by the Dutch West India Company in 1629 to encourage Dutch colonization. In 1707 the Vanderheyden family acquired the property, which was laid out in 1786 as Vanderheyden’s Ferry and renamed in 1789 for the ancient city of Troy.[P1]TroyTroy, N.Y.BenFrantzDale[ML1]Troy is said to be the source of the U.S. national symbol Uncle Sam. During the War of 1812, large contracts for U.S. Army beef were filled by businessman Samuel Wilson (locally called “Uncle Sam”) of Troy. Government purchasers stamped “U.S. Beef” on the barrels, misinterpreted as “Uncle Sam’s beef”; according to tradition, this gave rise to the popular symbol.[P2]Troy was an early seat of the American iron and steel industry. The city’s clothing industry supposedly originated with the invention in the early 1800s of the detachable collar by a Troy housewife. Clothing dominated the city’s economy after the introduction of the sewing machine in 1852, but a more diversified economy (including auto-parts, high-technology, clothing, and heavy gardening equipment industries) now prevails.

The so-called Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence (a series of anti-British resolutions) was signed there in May 1775. During the American Revolution the town was occupied (1780) by Lord Cornwallis, who received such hostile treatment he dubbed it “the hornet’s nest of rebellion” (now the city’s official emblem). Charlotte was the centre of gold production in the country until the California Gold Rush of 1849, and a mint was located there (1837–61 and 1867–1913). During the American Civil War the city was the site of a Confederate headquarters and hospital.

The first settlement (about 1750) in what is now Durham was called Prattsburg for William Pratt, a landowner. When Pratt refused to give land for a North Carolina Railroad station, Bartlett Durham donated a plot about 2 miles (3 km) to the west. The town that grew up there was known as Durhamville, Durham Station, and Durham’s before its name was shortened to Durham. It was the site of the surrender on April 26, 1865, of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston to Union General William Tecumseh Sherman, which effectively ended the American Civil War. It was incorporated in 1866 and again in 1869, the first charter having been invalidated by Congress since North Carolina had not yet been readmitted to the Union.[P1]Durham: Bennett Place State Historic SiteReconstructed kitchen house (left) and farmhouse, with the Unity Monument in the background, Bennett Place State Historic Site, Durham, North Carolina.Ildar Sagdejev[ML1]The tobacco industry, which transformed Durham into a flourishing manufacturing centre by 1900, was pioneered by Robert Morris in 1858; John R. Green began making his famous Bull Durham blend after the Civil War. The leading role in the industry’s development, however, was played by the Duke family after their factory opened there in 1874. Durham also developed an important textile industry. Both of these activities are now secondary to high technology such as the manufacture of electronic and precision equipment.[P2]Durham became an educational, medical, and research centre in large part through the philanthropy of the Duke family. Duke University, which was established by James Buchanan Duke in 1924, was constructed around Trinity College. North Carolina Central University (1910), part of the University of North Carolina system, and Durham Technical Community College (1961) are in the city as well. Durham is a national leader in health-related activities, which are focused on the renowned Duke University Medical Center and many private companies.

Laid out in 1754 on the site of a Native American village (Acconeech or Occaneechi), it was initially called Orange, then Corbinton (for Francis Corbin, a colonial official), and in 1759 it was incorporated as Childsburgh (for Thomas Childs, the provincial attorney general). It was renamed Hillsboro in 1766 to honour Wills Hill (1718–93), earl of Hillsborough, then secretary of state for the colonies; it became Hillsborough in 1965. In 1768–71 the town was the focus of disturbances by the Regulators (colonials who fought against high taxes and legal fees and corrupt royalist officials), and during the American Revolution it served for a time as state capital. It was the site of the third provincial congress (1775), and the General Assembly met there in 1778, 1780, and 1782–84. British troops under Lord Cornwallis occupied the town in 1781 prior to the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. The first state convention to ratify the U.S. Constitution was held there in 1788, but the vote failed; the Constitution was ratified the following year at Fayetteville. Many Revolution-era buildings have been preserved, including Heartsease, home of Governor Thomas Burke and scene of his capture by Tories in 1781.[P1]Hillsborough: Ayr MountAyr Mount, a restored plantation house built in 1815, Hillsborough, North Carolina.© Jeffrey M.

North Carolina"Nags Head"Town"Dare county"eastern North Carolina"Nags Head, resort town, Dare county, eastern North Carolina, U.S. It is situated on Bodie Island (one of the Outer Banks barrier islands) between Roanoke Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, just south of Kitty Hawk. It was so named, according to legend, because unscrupulous shipwreckers tied lanterns to the necks of ponies (“nags”) and marched them along the high dunes to simulate the lights of boats at anchor—a ruse that tricked captains into running their ships aground on the shoals, where their cargo was seized. The place now has a large cottage colony and is popular for boating, swimming, and beachcombing. High, constantly shifting sand formations run along the sandy spit, notably at adjacent Jockey’s Ridge State Park; the park’s rolling sands and dunes, which reach some 135 feet (40 metres) or more above the sea, are the highest sand dunes on the East Coast and attract sand skiers and hang gliders. Kill Devil Hills, between Nags Head and Kitty Hawk, is the site of the Wright brothers’ historic flights in 1903, and Roanoke Island is a short distance to the south.

The second oldest town in North Carolina, New Bern was settled in 1710 by Freiherr (baron) Christophe von Graffenried of Bern, Switzerland. It was incorporated in 1723 after near destruction by Native Americans. Colonial North Carolina’s first printing press (1749), used to print the first newspaper, the North Carolina Gazette, and first tax-supported school, New Bern Academy (1764), were located there. New Bern served as the colonial and state capital from 1746 to 1792. Tryon Palace, built in 1767–70 by the royal governor, William Tryon, was the first capitol; it was restored (1952–59) as a state historic site. The first and second provincial congresses in North Carolina opposing the British met there in 1774 and 1775, respectively.[P1]New Bern: Stanly HouseStanly House, New Bern, North Carolina.© Travel Bug/Shutterstock.com[ML1]New Bern had a thriving seaport trade with New England, England, and the West Indies through Pamlico Sound until the city was captured by Union forces in 1862 and occupied for the remainder of the American Civil War. Its connection with the Intracoastal Waterway and the port at Morehead City, 35 miles (55 km) south-southeast, has made it the service centre for nearby summer resorts, the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station at Cherry Point, and farmlands producing corn (maize), tobacco, and cotton. The soft drink Pepsi-Cola was invented by New Bern pharmacist Caleb Bradham in 1898. The city’s diversified manufactures today include chemicals, boats, wood products, and plumbing fixtures.[P2]The New Bern National Cemetery has the graves of many Civil War dead.

Originally called Wake Courthouse, it was renamed for Sir Walter Raleigh. The first capitol, completed in 1794, burned in 1831 and was replaced by the present building, completed in 1840. It stands in the middle of a large square and is considered an outstanding example of Greek Revival architecture. Capitol Square is surrounded by various state and historic buildings and churches. During the American Civil War, Raleigh served as a Confederate headquarters until April 13, 1865, when Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman occupied the city without resistance.[P2]Raleigh is a major point for retail shipping and wholesale distribution for eastern North Carolina. After World War II the city attracted numerous factories manufacturing a wide variety of products, now including communications equipment, electronic equipment, computers, and processed foods; in addition it is a research and development centre for textiles and chemicals. Services are also important, and a number of insurance companies have their home offices or regional headquarters there.[P3]The city is an educational centre and the site of North Carolina State University (1887; part of the University of North Carolina system), Shaw University (1865), and Meredith (1891), St. Augustine’s (1896), and Peace (1857) colleges.

The area was settled in the mid-1700s by Virginians after the war (1711–13) with the Tuscarora Indians. The name Rocky Mount, first used in 1816 to designate the location of the area’s first post office, was probably derived from the rocky mounds and ridges along its site near the falls of the Tar River. After the arrival of the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad in 1840, it developed as a rail centre and merged with the village of Rocky Mount Hills (established 1818) that had grown around cotton mills by the falls. Rocky Mount was destroyed by Union troops in 1863 during the American Civil War.[P1]The railroad tracks of the Seaboard Coast Line bisect the main street and mark the boundary between the two counties. The city has one of the world’s largest bright-leaf tobacco markets, and its diversified manufactures include pharmaceuticals, textiles, furniture, fabricated metals, and chemicals.

During the American Revolution it served as temporary headquarters for both the troops of the British general Lord Cornwallis and the American general Nathanael Greene in February 1781, before the Battle of Guilford Courthouse; a small skirmish between the two occurred at Old Trading Ford, 6 miles (10 km) east. A large Confederate prison was established in the city in 1861 during the American Civil War and operated, often under deplorable conditions, until Salisbury was occupied in 1865 by Union troops under General George Stoneman, who burned the prison. Salisbury National Cemetery (1865) contains the graves of some 12,000 Union prisoners who died there.[P2]Salisbury serves a largely agricultural region raising corn (maize), soybeans, and livestock.

Bismarck was founded in 1872 and was originally named Edwinton in honour of Edwin L. Johnson, who was a proponent of a transcontinental railway. In 1873 the city was renamed in honour of the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck in the hope of attracting German investment in the railway. That year the railway arrived and contributed greatly to the community’s growth. With the discovery of gold (1874) in the Black Hills (to the southwest, now in South Dakota), Bismarck became an outfitting centre for prospectors.[P2]In 1883 the capital of Dakota Territory was moved from Yankton (now in South Dakota) to Bismarck; when the territory was divided and the two states admitted to the Union in 1889, Bismarck became the capital of the northern state. It has grown steadily and has become the region’s business, trade, transportation, education, and health care centre. Oil, gas, and coal production and distribution are major factors in the city’s economy, and there is a refinery at nearby Mandan. Government, business services, insurance, dairy processing, and the manufacture of farm and construction equipment are also important. Area agriculture includes livestock raising and the production of wheat, hay, and oats.[P3]The state capitol (occupied 1935) is a 19-story skyscraper; on its grounds are the governor’s mansion and the North Dakota Heritage Center, a historical museum. Bismarck is also known as a site on the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail and as the home of the Dakota Zoo. The city is the seat of Bismarck State (community) College (founded 1939) and the University of Mary (founded 1955). Southwest of the city are On-a-Slant Indian Village, originally built by the Mandan in the late 16th century but abandoned in 1781, and Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park; to the north, Double Ditch Indian Village State Historic Site preserves the ruins of a Mandan village.

Creel; in 1884 it was renamed Devils Lake, a misinterpretation of the Sioux name Miniwaukan, meaning “Spirit Water,” “Lake Great One,” or “Lake Holy One.” The city was at the head of steamboat navigation on Devils Lake, a closed-basin lake (one having no river outlet) with constantly fluctuating water levels. By 1909 water levels had dropped so much that navigation ceased; the lake reached a low point of only 2 feet (0.6 metre) deep in 1940. In 1993 water levels began to rise dramatically because of increased rainfall and decreased evaporation. By the turn of the 21st century, the water had risen some 25 feet (7.5 metres), causing extensive flooding.[P2]The city of Devils Lake is a trade centre for an agricultural area producing grain (primarily wheat, corn [maize], barley, and sunflowers), livestock, and dairy products. It is the site of Lake Region State (community) College (1941). The Devils Lake area is a popular hunting and fishing spot. Sullys Hill National Game Preserve, about 10 miles (16 km) southwest, holds an annual birding and nature festival. The Spirit Lake Sioux reservation is to the south across the lake. Nearby are Grahams Island State Park and Shelvers Grove and Black Tiger Bay state recreation areas. Fort Totten State Historic Site is a well-preserved military outpost dating from 1867.

Founded in 1871 by the Northern Pacific Railway at its crossing point on the river, Fargo served as an outfitting post for settlers with its rail and steamboat facilities. It was named for William George Fargo, a partner in Wells, Fargo & Company and a pioneer in the shipment of goods by express. The development of wheat growing in the area consolidated Fargo’s role as a transportation, marketing, and distribution centre, and the fertile soil drew Norwegian immigrants. Fargo is located in the state’s top agricultural county and produces soybeans, sugar beets, wheat, corn (maize), sunflowers, beans, and barley. Local industries include the manufacture of farm implements and construction equipment, software production, and beet-sugar processing. North Dakota State University (established in Fargo as an agricultural college in 1890) is a noted centre of agricultural research. The city is also a regional medical centre and has an international airport. Adjacent West Fargo is a rapidly growing suburban community. Fargo is the home of the Fargo-Moorhead Symphony Orchestra and the Fargo-Moorhead Civic Opera. The Plains Art Museum houses regional folk and Native American art.

Permanent settlement began in 1870, and the community grew with steamboat traffic and the arrival of the Great Northern Railway in 1880. It flourished as a trade and agricultural centre for a fertile wheat-growing region and attracted Norwegian immigrants. In 1997 Grand Forks and East Grand Forks were devastated by floodwaters from the Red River, which forced the evacuation of nearly all the cities’ residents. During the flood a fire ravaged the historic Grand Forks downtown area.[P2]Grand Forks is a trade and processing centre for the produce (wheat, barley, soybeans, sunflowers, beans, corn [maize], potatoes, and sugar beets) grown in the surrounding Red River valley. The city is also an important centre of transportation, commerce, health care, and education and has some furniture manufacturing and an Internet commerce customer-service facility.

Settled in 1864 by Morgan T. Rich and initially named Richland, it was the second permanent settlement in North Dakota. It was officially founded in 1869 and renamed Chahinkapa (a Sioux word meaning “End of the Woods”); by 1873 the name was established as Wahpeton, a Sioux word meaning “Dwellers Among Leaves” and the name of one of the Sioux tribes. A railway line was extended to Breckenridge in 1872, which contributed to the rise of flatboat building in the area. The arrival of the railroad in Wahpeton in 1880 contributed to the city’s development as a trade centre for livestock, grain, and dairy producers in the area. Wahpeton lies in the state’s most fertile agricultural region, which produces primarily soybeans, corn (maize), wheat, sugar beets, sunflowers, potatoes, turkeys, and hogs. Agriculture-related industry includes snack food production and the processing of corn, soybeans, and sugar beets. Manufacturing—including farm and construction equipment, building materials, data storage products, canvas, machine tools, wood products, and metal products—contributes to the local economy, along with transportation services.

Assiniboin, Crow, Blackfoot, and Cree Indians traded with American Fur Company representatives at Fort Union, built in 1828 near the junction of the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers (about 25 miles [40 km] southwest of the city; now Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site). Originally called Little Muddy, the site was first settled in the 1870s by Robert Matthews, who cut hay for cavalry horses at Fort Buford (now a state historic site southwest of Williston). An important factor in the community’s growth was the arrival of the Great Northern Railway (1887) and the location there of its division headquarters. The community was then renamed by James J. Hill, builder and president of the railway, for a financier friend, D. Willis James of New York City. The surrounding agricultural region produces wheat, rye, oats, barley, sugar beets, potatoes, and livestock.

Ohio"Akron"City"Summit county"northeastern Ohio"Akron, city, seat (1842) of Summit county, northeastern Ohio, U.S. It lies along the Cuyahoga River, about 40 miles (64 km) south-southeast of Cleveland. Akron is the centre of a metropolitan area that includes the cities of Cuyahoga Falls, Tallmadge, and Stow and several villages. At 1,081 feet (329 metres) above sea level, it was named for its “high place” (Greek: akros) on the watershed between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes. Laid out in 1825 by Gen. Simon Perkins, commissioner of the Ohio Canal Fund, the town was assured substantial growth by the completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal in 1827 and of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal in 1840, linking it with Pittsburgh. Waterpower and transportation supplied by these canals led to Akron’s early development as an industrial centre. The abundant water supply and the arrival of the railroads prompted Benjamin F. Goodrich to move a small rubber factory to the site in 1871. This industry rapidly expanded with the advent of the automobile and the demand for rubber tires. Between 1910 and 1920 the city’s population tripled to more than 200,000, and Akron became known as the “rubber capital of the world” and the international or American headquarters of the far-flung giants of the rubber industry—Firestone, General Tire, Goodrich, and Goodyear; by the late 20th century, however, only Goodyear remained. The city’s manufactures are now well diversified and, apart from a wide variety of polymer and plastic products, include farm machinery, automotive parts, toys, power-generating equipment, and chemicals. The city has largely shifted away from a manufacturing economy, however, while the service and trade sectors have grown. In the late 20th century some manufacturing plants and downtown stores were closed, but by the late 1990s several large-scale projects had succeeded in stimulating a revitalization of the downtown area.[P1]Akron, University ofGoodyear Polymer Center, University of Akron, Ohio.Rick Dikeman[ML1]The hangar at the city’s airport is the site of the Goodyear Wingfoot Lake Airship Base (for airships [blimps]).

Akron is an important truck terminal and distribution point between the eastern seaboard and the Midwest.[P2]More than 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares) in the city are occupied by parks, and surrounding lakes and reservoirs and several golf courses afford recreation facilities; the southern limit of Cuyahoga Valley National Park is just north of the city. The World Series of Golf, played in Akron, is an annual professional tournament. Nearby Derby Downs is the site of the annual All-American Soap Box Derby for homemade gravity-powered cars. The city’s cultural centres include the Akron Art Museum and the Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens (with antiques dating from the 14th century). The construction of a new convention centre (1994), the National Inventors Hall of Fame (1995), and a new stadium for the minor-league baseball Aeros all contributed to a downtown renaissance in the late 1990s.

Ohio"Bellefontaine"City"Logan county"west central Ohio"Bellefontaine, city, seat (1820) of Logan county, west central Ohio, U.S., about 45 miles (70 km) northwest of Columbus. The site was once occupied by a Shawnee village called Blue Jacket’s Town (for a Shawnee chief who was one of the tribal leaders at the Battle of Fallen Timbers [1794]). The first American settlers arrived in 1806; the village was named Bellefontaine (“Beautiful Fountain”) in 1820 for the local natural springs. It became a service centre for a farming area, but its early importance as a railroad town has declined. Industries include the manufacture of power tools, circuit breakers, electric motors, machinery, and plating. The first concrete street in America was laid around the courthouse in 1891. The state’s highest point, Campbell Hill (1,549 feet [472 metres]), is 2 miles (3 km) east. Also in the vicinity are Indian Lake State Park, the Ohio and Zane caverns, and the Piatt Castles, Mac-A-Cheek (1864, built in the style of a Norman chateau) and Mac-O-Chee (1879, modelled after a Flemish castle).

Ohio"Bowling Green"City"Wood county"northwestern Ohio"Bowling Green, city, seat (1866) of Wood county, northwestern Ohio, U.S., about 25 miles (40 km) south of Toledo. The site, originally a swamp wilderness, was first settled by Elisha Martindale in 1832. The town was laid out in 1835 and named for Bowling Green, Ky. The swampland, drained by German immigrants and transformed into productive farmland, now supports livestock, grain, and tomatoes. Oil was discovered in the area (1886), and a short-lived industrial boom (mainly glass manufacture) followed until the wells ran dry. The founding of a state normal school (which became Bowling Green State University in 1935) in 1910 and the construction of a large tomato-canning plant four years later boosted the city’s development. Light manufactures now include plastic and rubber products, automotive parts, mobile homes, adjustable seating, stamping dies, electrical components, floor-maintenance equipment, and chemicals. The Black Swamp Arts Festival (September) is an annual exhibition of visual arts, drama, and music by regional artists.

It is the focus of a metropolitan area that includes the cities of North Canton and Massillon and the village of East Canton. Laid out in 1805, it was probably named by its founder, Bezaleel Wells, for his friend Capt. John O’Donnell’s estate, Canton, in Baltimore, Md., which was built with profits from trade with China.[P1]Canton: McKinley National MemorialMcKinley National Memorial, Canton, Ohio.Kc8wvj[ML1]The community developed from a manufacturer of plows, reapers, and farm equipment into an important industrial centre.

After his assassination in 1901 his body was returned there for burial. He, his wife, and two daughters are now entombed in the McKinley National Memorial in Westlawn Cemetery. The American Professional Football Association (later the National Football League) was formed in Canton in 1920 with Jim Thorpe of the Canton Bulldogs as its first president. To honour the city’s role in organizing the sport, the Pro Football Hall of Fame was established there in 1963.[P3]Canton is the seat of Malone College (a Quaker institution founded in 1892 in Cleveland), the Stark Campus of Kent State University (1946), Walsh University (1958, Roman Catholic), and Stark State College of Technology (1960).

It is overlooked (northeast) by Mount Logan, which is depicted on the official state seal. It was first settled (1796) by Virginians led by Nathaniel Massie, and its name was derived from a Shawnee word meaning “principal town.” Chillicothe served as capital of the Northwest Territory (1800–03), was incorporated as a city in 1802, and was twice the state capital (1803–10; 1812–16). The first state constitution was written there. Some of the state’s best-preserved prehistoric Indian earthworks are in the vicinity, including Hopewell Culture National Historical Park.

Columbia, the first settlement, was founded by Benjamin Stites of Pennsylvania near the mouth of the Little Miami in 1788. Another settlement was laid out and called Losantiville, and a third, North Bend, was established a short distance down the Ohio. Fort Washington was built near Losantiville in 1789. In the following year, General Arthur St. Clair, newly appointed governor of the Northwest Territory, renamed the town to honour the Revolutionary War officers’ Society of the Cincinnati and made it the county seat. Growth began after General Anthony Wayne’s victory (1794) at Fallen Timbers lessened the threat of Indian attacks. Cincinnati emerged as a river port after 1811, when the first steamboat west of the Allegheny Mountains, the New Orleans, arrived on its downriver voyage from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Miami and Erie Canal was completed to Dayton in 1829, and the first section of the Little Miami Railway was laid in 1843. River commerce, which reached its height in 1852, stimulated steamboat building and industry. At that time, because of its renown as a pork-packing centre, the city was often called “Porkopolis.” Other titles, such as “Queen City” and “Queen of the West,” were embraced by Cincinnatians in the early 19th century—the latter nickname, which first appeared in print in 1819, was immortalized in a poem (1854) by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.[P3]Map of southern Ohio showing (inset, lower left) Cincinnati c. 1900 from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML3] In 1842 Cincinnati was one of the few American cities admired by the British author Charles Dickens. The city grew rapidly before the American Civil War, largely through an influx of German and Irish immigrants. Cincinnati had close commercial and cultural ties with the South, and, when war broke out, many sympathized with the Southern cause. However, the city had been the home of such prominent abolitionists as Henry Ward Beecher and Levi Coffin and an important station on the Underground Railroad. Cincinnati remained loyal to the Union, and citizens rallied to the city’s defense when it was threatened by a Confederate force in September 1862.[P4] Cincinnati’s economy flourished during and after the war as new markets in the North were established, and rail connections to the South revived trade there in the 1880s. The population grew steadily, and many civic and cultural institutions were founded. A long period of government corruption was followed by one of reform and civic rejuvenation in the 1920s. Flooding in 1937 devastated low-lying areas of the city, but flood-control measures taken since then have reduced the threat. Beginning in the last decades of the 20th century, the central city was revitalized through a combination of historic preservation and restoration and new civic and commercial construction.[P5] The city’s population peaked at 504,000 in 1950 and thereafter declined, which was mirrored by steady population growth in the metropolitan area. Concurrently, the proportion of people of European ancestry dropped considerably, and that for African Americans rose to more than two-fifths of the total.[P6] [H3]The contemporary city Services (wholesale and retail trade, government, education) constitute the main component of Cincinnati’s economy. The city’s highly diversified manufactures include food products, transportation equipment, soap products, chemicals, industrial machinery, pharmaceuticals, metal products, textiles, furniture, and cosmetics; printing is also important. The city remains a national transportation hub that includes one of the country’s largest inland coal ports and an international airport located to the southwest in Kentucky.[P7] A noted cultural centre, Cincinnati has a symphony orchestra and ballet and theatre ensembles. The Cincinnati Opera, founded in 1920, is the second oldest opera company in the country. Cincinnati Museum Center, located in the renovated Union Terminal railway station, includes a children’s museum and museums of history and of natural history and science. The Cincinnati Art Museum and Taft Museum of Art have noted collections. In 2003 the Contemporary Arts Center (founded in 1939 as the Modern Art Society) moved into a new building designed by Zaha Hadid. The city is the seat of the University of Cincinnati (1819), the Cincinnati State Technical and Community College (1969), and the Union Institute and University (1964). There are two Roman Catholic institutes of higher education—Xavier University (1831) and the College of Mount St. Joseph (1920)—and the Athenaeum of Ohio (1829), a seminary. Other religious institutions include Hebrew Union College–Jewish Institute of Religion (1875), the oldest rabbinic college in the United States, and Cincinnati Christian University (1924; Churches of Christ).[P8] Also of interest are the birthplace of President William Howard Taft (at Mount Auburn, designated a national historic site in 1969), the Harriet Beecher Stowe House (1833), and the Tyler-Davidson Fountain (1871) by the sculptor August von Kreling. The John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge (1856–67), designed by Roebling, has a main span of 1,057 feet (322 metres) and links Cincinnati and Covington; it was the second bridge across the Ohio. The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, the second oldest zoo in the United States, is notable for its successful breeding of animals in captivity and for its use of naturalistic surroundings.[P9] The Great American Ball Park (opened 2003), built to resemble ballparks of the early 20th century, is the home of the Cincinnati Reds (1869), the country’s oldest professional baseball team; the Bengals (gridiron football) play at nearby Paul Brown Stadium (2000). Both venues are located along the river and flank the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center (2004), which offers exhibits and educational programs. The Showboat Majestic, a historic monument, stages popular theatre productions on the riverfront, and renovated stern-wheelers are based across the Ohio River at Covington. Northeast of Cincinnati is a popular theme amusement park. The birthplace of President Ulysses S. Grant (restored as a museum) is along the Ohio at Point Pleasant, about 20 miles (32 km) southeast.[P10] [END-OF-CONTENT]

READ MORE History Erie Indians in the region were driven out by the Iroquois in the 17th century. The French established a trading post in the vicinity in the mid-18th century. In 1786, three years after the American Revolution, when the Ohio country was opened for settlement, Connecticut laid claim to a vast area of land (the Western Reserve) in northeastern Ohio. Moses Cleaveland, from the Connecticut Land Company, arrived with surveyors at the mouth of the Cuyahoga in July 1796 to map the area. He founded and laid out the town of Cleaveland. (In 1832 an a in Cleaveland was dropped to shorten a newspaper’s masthead.)[P3] The city’s growth was slow until 1832, when the Ohio and Erie Canal (begun in 1825 to connect Lake Erie and the Ohio River) was completed. In the 1850s railroads increased the community’s commercial and industrial activity. When St. Marys Falls Canal (Soo Canal) between Lakes Superior and Huron was opened in 1855, Cleveland became Lake Erie’s transshipment point for lumber, copper and iron ore, and rail shipments of coal and farm produce. The American Civil War provided the initial stimulus for iron and steel processing, metals fabrication, oil refining (John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil there), and chemical manufacturing. Suburban trains were developed at the end of the 19th century. By the 1930s Cleveland had the appearance of a modern metropolis, with main roads converging on its Public Square, which was dominated by the 708-foot (216-metre) Terminal Tower. Rapid-transit lines now extend to Shaker Heights and East Cleveland (east) and to the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport (southwest).[P4]Map of Cleveland, Ohio, U.S. (c. 1900), from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML4] Cleveland’s economy, hard hit by the Great Depression of the 1930s, experienced renewed growth during World War II. However, the city’s industrial mainstays subsequently declined, a decline matched by a precipitous drop in population; in 2000 Cleveland’s population was only about half of what it had been in the peak year of 1950, when it reached 915,000. Tens of thousands (mainly those of European ancestry) moved to the suburbs, but many others left the area as jobs disappeared. Economic hardship especially affected the city’s large and less-mobile African American community, which by 2000 constituted more than half of the city’s population. In 1966 Cleveland’s Hough district was the scene of violent racial disorders. Municipal government faced mounting budgetary problems, capped by default on bank loans in the late 1970s. In addition, environmental pollution became severe, a condition infamously highlighted by a June 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River caused by floating chemical wastes.[P5] In 1967 Carl Stokes was elected mayor of Cleveland, the first African American to win such office in a major U.S. city. Under Stokes and his successors (white and black), the city undertook a long revitalization process. Beginning in the 1960s, much of the downtown area was rebuilt, and since the 1980s steps have been taken to improve the city’s environment. Notable effort has been directed at cleaning up the Cuyahoga. The downtown skyline, long dominated by Terminal Tower (1930), was dramatically altered by the addition of BP Tower (1985) and the 63-story Key Tower (1991), at the time of its completion the tallest building between New York City and Chicago.[P6] [H3]The contemporary city Heavy industry remains important to the city’s economy. Manufactures are highly diversified and include primary steel, steel products, motor vehicles, automotive parts, medical products, greeting cards, processed foods, chemicals, and electronic equipment. Services (including health care, banking and finance, insurance, and government) account for the major proportion of the economy. Cleveland’s port is one of the largest on the Great Lakes, and the city has extensive rail and highway connections. Scores of medical and industrial research centres are headquartered in the area, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s John H. Glenn Research Center and the Cleveland Clinic, renowned for cardiac care.[P7] University Circle, with Case Western Reserve University (1967; a federation of Case Institute of Technology [1880] and Western Reserve University [1826]) as its locus, is the city’s cultural centre. Among its more than 35 medical, educational, cultural, and religious institutions are the Cleveland Institute of Art (1882), the Cleveland Institute of Music (1920), the Cleveland Museum of Art, Severance Hall (home of the Cleveland Orchestra), the Western Reserve Historical Society, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, HealthSpace Cleveland, and Cleveland Botanical Garden. Other educational institutions in the city include Cuyahoga Community College (1963) and Cleveland State University (1964). Suburban schools include three Roman Catholic institutions—John Carroll University (1886) in University Heights, Notre Dame College (1923) in South Euclid, and Ursuline College (1871) in Pepper Pike—and Baldwin-Wallace College (1845) in Berea.[P8]Case Western Reserve UniversityHaydn Hall, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.Rick DikemanCleveland Museum of ArtCleveland Museum of Art, Ohio.Franchécomte[ML8] City, county, and federal office buildings, the Cleveland Public Library (with one of the largest holdings of any city library in the country), and the Cleveland Convention Center are downtown, near the lakefront.

The state takes its name from the Ohio River, which in turn traces its name to an Iroquoian word meaning “great water.” READ MORE History Columbus was planned in 1812 as a political centre by the Ohio legislature and was named for Christopher Columbus. The state government moved to the city in 1816 from Chillicothe, and Columbus later absorbed the nearby earlier settlement of Franklinton (founded 1797). The city experienced significant growth after a feeder branch of the Ohio and Erie Canal was opened to it in 1831 and the Cumberland (National) Road from Maryland reached it in 1836. The first railroad arrived in 1850, further stimulating development.[P2] During the American Civil War, Columbus became a major staging area for Union forces, and Camp Chase, one of the North’s largest facilities for Confederate prisoners of war, was built on the city’s west side. The local economy continued to boom after the war. Columbus became one of the country’s major manufacturers of horse-drawn vehicles. By 1900, when the population exceeded 125,000, the city had emerged as an important transportation and commercial centre. Following damaging floods in 1913, the Scioto River was widened and levees, retaining walls, and bridges constructed, which allowed riverfront development.[P3] Unprecedented industrial growth occurred after 1940. A large aircraft plant established there provided the initial stimulus, but many branches of national companies were also attracted to the area. Columbus continued to grow in size mainly because it pursued a policy of annexing adjacent land; between 1950 and 2000 the city’s land area increased fivefold, and its population nearly doubled. By 1990 it was Ohio’s largest city. People of European ancestry have long constituted the great majority of its residents, but the African American proportion of the population has steadily increased to about one-fourth of the total.[P4] [H3]The contemporary city In the early 21st century the fastest-growing sectors of the local economy were education and health, transportation and utilities, and professional and business services. High-technology industries and manufacturing (automobiles, motorcycles, communications equipment, steel and steel products, and nutritional supplements) were also important. The city’s favourable geographic position was enhanced by the presence of main-line railroads, an extensive highway network, and an international airport. Nearly half of the U.S. population was located within a 500-mile (about 800-km) radius of Columbus.[P5]Statehouse, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.Ellis–Sawyer/Shostal Associates[ML5] The main campus of the Ohio State University (1870), which has one of the largest enrollments of any American university, occupies a large site north of downtown.

William Wetmore founded the settlement of Manchester on the Cuyahoga River in 1812 and by 1815 had built the first of a series of dams and mills to harness the power of the river’s falls (the scenic Big Falls, for which the city was named, have since been eliminated by a dam constructed in 1912; remaining are the Little Falls, located adjacent to the city’s downtown). Thereafter, waterpowered manufacturing grew rapidly. The town’s name was changed to Cuyahoga Falls in 1828 to avoid confusion with another Manchester in Ohio. Although now mainly a residential suburb, Cuyahoga Falls has some light industry, including the manufacture of chemicals, vinyl products, tools and dies, steel molds, air filters, and packaging. Cuyahoga Valley National Park is 2 miles (3 km) north; it contains Blossom Music Center, the summer home of the Cleveland Orchestra. Inc. village, 1868; city, 1920. Pop.

Ohio"Dayton"City"Montgomery county"southwestern Ohio"Dayton, city, seat (1803) of Montgomery county, southwestern Ohio, U.S., located 54 miles (87 km) northeast of Cincinnati, on a low floodplain of the Great Miami River, at the confluence of the Stillwater and Mad rivers and of Wolf Creek. It is the heart of a metropolitan area that includes the cities of Kettering, Miamisburg, Xenia, Fairborn, Oakwood, Centerville, Beavercreek, and Vandalia.[P1]Dayton Art Institute, Dayton, OhioMilt and Joan Mann/CameraMann International[ML1]Following the peace treaty with the Shawnee Indians, signed at Greenville (1795), the area was opened to white settlement. The town was laid out by a group of Revolutionary War veterans, including Jonathan Dayton from New Jersey, for whom it was named. It developed as a river port for the shipment of agricultural produce, mainly to New Orleans. The opening of the Miami and Erie Canal, from Dayton to Cincinnati, in 1829, and the arrival in 1851 of a railroad to Springfield stimulated Dayton’s commercial and industrial growth. The town became the home of the cash register after the mechanical money drawer was invented there in 1879 by James Ritty and perfected by John H. Patterson in the 1880s. In addition, the automobile self-starter was developed there by Charles F. Kettering, who, along with Edward A. Deeds, also produced ignition systems and electric lighting equipment for farms. In 1892 Wilbur and Orville Wright opened their bicycle repair shop in Dayton, where they conducted experiments that led to the first sustained and controlled flight of a powered airplane, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903; a monolith has been erected in memory of the brothers, who are buried in the city’s Woodland Cemetery.[P2]In 1913 the most disastrous of a series of floods occurred in the area. After this, the Miami Conservancy District, a comprehensive flood-control project, was created. Dayton experienced the suburbanization typical of many North American cities after World War II; the central city lost residents and businesses while the metropolitan area grew overall. By the 1990s, efforts to revitalize the city centre had succeeded in bringing new commercial and residential development to the city.[P3]Dayton is now the heart of a large diversified urban complex and a market and distribution centre for a fertile agricultural region. It is also a national aviation centre, stemming from the establishment of experimental aviation laboratories during World Wars I and II and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (1946), with its modern aviation complex, Air Force Institute of Technology (1947), and museum (1935; moved to current site 1971). Manufactures include auto parts and equipment, steel and aluminum products, machine tools, refrigerators, air conditioners, computers, office equipment, printing presses, and plastics.[P4]Within the metropolitan area are the University of Dayton (Roman Catholic; 1850), Wright State University (1967), the United Theological Seminary (United Methodist; 1871), Sinclair Community College (1887), and Miami-Jacobs (junior) Career College (1860). Dayton has an art institute, a museum of natural history, and a symphony orchestra. The Dayton home of poet Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872–1906) is preserved as a state memorial and museum; the city’s Greek Revival-style Old Courthouse (1850) now houses the Montgomery County Historical Society museum. Recreational facilities include Carillon Park, noted for concerts and historical exhibits (including a replica of the Wright Brothers bicycle shop). The Miamisburg Mound, one of the largest conical earthworks built by the prehistoric Adena culture (with a height of 65 feet [20 metres] and a circumference of 877 feet [267 metres]), is located just southwest of the city.

Laid out in 1829, Defiance became a market for the farm produce of the Maumee valley and developed industrially after the completion of the Miami and Erie Canal (1845). Manufactures now include truck and automobile parts, roller bearings, ferrous castings, and glass fibre. Fort Defiance Historical Park marks the site of Fort Defiance (the namesake of the city and the county), built in 1794 by Gen. “Mad” Anthony Wayne for operations against the Indians. Fort Winchester Bridge (1936), which spans the Auglaize, commemorates the fort built in 1812 by Gen. William Henry Harrison (later U.S. president). The probable birthplace of the Ottawa chief Pontiac is nearby on the north bank of the Maumee. John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed), the orchardist, established a nursery (1828) outside of Defiance.

The Delaware Indians had a village in the vicinity before Col. Moses Byxbe of Massachusetts settled on the east bank of the river in 1804. The town was laid out in 1808 and became a popular health resort because of its close proximity to a sulfur spring. Ohio Wesleyan University (1842) was built around the town’s Mansion House (now Elliot Hall). The Methodist Theological School in Ohio was opened in Delaware in 1960. Perkins Observatory, maintained by Ohio Wesleyan University, is 4 miles (6 km) south of the city. A stone monument marks the birthplace of U.S. president Rutherford B. Hayes. After World War II there was some industrial growth; the city’s manufactures now include industrial and automotive coatings, copper products, stone and concrete, tools and dies, building materials, and chemicals.

Ohio"East Cleveland"City"Cuyahoga county"northeastern Ohio"East Cleveland, city, suburb of Cleveland, Cuyahoga county, northeastern Ohio, U.S., just southeast of Lake Erie. The site was settled in 1801 by farmers, and East Cleveland township was organized in 1805. The boundaries were reduced because of annexations by the city of Cleveland, and the village, which was incorporated in 1895, became a city in 1911. Suburban growth was aided by the advent of the streetcar. From the 1960s to the ’80s East Cleveland transformed from a predominantly white suburb into a predominantly African American one; a significant flight of capital and business accompanied this population shift, and at the start of the 21st century the community was one of Cleveland’s poorest suburbs. Primarily residential, the city has some industrial development and is the site of Nela Park, headquarters of General Electric’s lighting division and one of the first planned industrial research parks (built 1911–21) in the United States. Its Forest Hill Park (shared with neighbouring Cleveland Heights) was once part of the summer estate of oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. The East Cleveland Theater, founded in 1968, presents several major productions annually and offers a range of arts instruction and community programs. Pop.

Founded in 1798 by Thomas Fawcett, an Irish Quaker, it was originally called St. Clair and then Fawcettstown. After it became a village in 1834, it was renamed for Liverpool, Eng. The city is known for its porcelain and pottery industry, which was established in 1840 to exploit local clay deposits. The Tri-State Pottery Festival is held there in June, and the Museum of Ceramics displays examples from throughout the industry’s history. The construction of the New Cumberland Locks and Dam at Stratton, a few miles downstream, and its nearness to Great Lakes ports and highways make the city an important river terminal. Ceramics and related products remain the core of the city’s industry; other manufactures include motor oil, industrial chemicals, plastics, and steel products.

The site was laid out by Joseph Vance and Elnathan Corry in 1821 and named for Col. James Findlay, who had built Fort Findlay, a local outpost in the War of 1812. In 1861, using the pen name Petroleum V. Nasby, the editor of the Findlay Jeffersonian, David Ross Locke, published the first of his satirical letters attacking slavery. Fishing in the Blanchard near old Misamore Mill inspired Tell Taylor to compose the popular song “Down by the Old Mill Stream.” During the 1880s Findlay was a booming centre of oil and natural gas production, and its Gas Jubilee of 1887 was one of the most spectacular celebrations ever staged in the area; the supply of petroleum had dwindled by the early 20th century. The city’s manufactures now include automobile parts, rubber tires, heavy machinery, laundry equipment, petroleum products, solid-state components, and plastics. Findlay also produces limestone and gravel and is a trading centre for a rich agricultural region producing wheat, soybeans, corn (maize), and several other crops, as well as hogs and cattle. The University of Findlay (Churches of God) was founded in 1882. A campus of Owens Community College (1983) is located in Findlay.

The third oldest European settlement in Ohio, it was founded in 1790 by the Scioto Company for Royalists fleeing the French Revolution who had been deceived by agents of the company into purchasing land certificates that were worthless. The company later, however, financed a settlement at the site, and some French moved there. The name means “City of the Gauls.” During the American Civil War its strategic location resulted in economic prosperity; troops were channeled through the city, warehouses were built, and river traffic on the Ohio River increased.[P1]Gallipolis is the shipping centre for a farming and coal-mining region and has light industry. The University of Rio Grande/Rio Grande Community College (1876) is 12 miles (19 km) northwest. Just south of the city is a lock and dam (1937) that raises the navigable depth of the Ohio River for 42 miles (67 km) and uplifts the Kanawha for 45 miles (72 km).

In 1794 a town called Fairfield was laid out adjoining Fort Hamilton, which was used in 1791–96 by Gen. Arthur St. Clair and Gen. “Mad” Anthony Wayne against the Indians. Fairfield was later renamed for Alexander Hamilton, the U.S. statesman. Rossville, across the river, merged with Hamilton in 1854, by which time the Miami and Erie Canal, with connections to Dayton and Cincinnati, had been built. This and the construction of a hydraulic power plant assured the city’s industrial future. The city suffered from the periodic flooding of the Miami, most seriously in 1913 when much of the city was devastated; the Miami Conservancy District was subsequently developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to control the river’s flooding. Hamilton is now an agricultural trading centre with diversified manufactures, including safes, automotive parts, paper, aircraft components, and industrial centrifuges.

Laid out about 1820, it was first called Jacob’s Well (for Jacob Foos, who dug for water there). Renamed in 1822 for Gen. Francis Marion of American Revolutionary War fame, it was incorporated as a village in 1830. Industrial development began in 1863 when Edward Huber, a German mechanic, founded a farm equipment factory there. The community soon became preeminent in the manufacture of excavating machinery (the leading industry until the 1990s). The steam shovel was introduced in 1874 and earned Marion the title “Shovel City.”[P1]Marion: Harding MemorialHarding Memorial, Marion, Ohio.Postdlf[ML1]Varied manufactures now include conveying and handling equipment, signposts, diapers, automobile and truck parts, packaging, household appliances, computer software, and processed foods.

Squatters in the 1770s and ’80s formed settlements (Hoglin’s, or Mercer’s, Town and Norristown) on the site. In 1795 Absalom Martin of New Jersey laid out a town called Jefferson, which was later abandoned; his son Ebenezer replanned the site as Martinsville in 1835, but it was later renamed for his father’s ferry. It developed as a farming community and way station for the transport of livestock and farm produce. Prior to the American Civil War it was a station on the Underground Railroad for escaping slaves. The arrival of the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad in 1852 and the discovery of coal in the locality gave impetus to the town’s industrial growth. Its manufactures include fabricated metals, galvanized steel, corrugated pipe, fertilizers, and baked goods.

Settled (1811) by New Englanders, it developed from two villages called Kendal and Brookfield and was named (1826), after its founding by James Duncan, for Bishop Jean-Baptiste Massillon, preacher and writer at the French court of Louis XIV. The Ohio and Erie Canal (opened from Akron to Massillon in 1828) led to the community’s early development as a major wheat-shipping centre. Massillon had a strong Quaker community, and from the 1820s it was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Although now industrialized, it remains a shipping centre for a wide agricultural region. Manufactures include bar and plate steel, surgical equipment, wire and screen products, steel castings, chemicals, plastics, cans, and food products. The Massillon Museum is housed in a former dry-goods store.

It is part of a metropolitan statistical area that also includes Cincinnati, some 30 miles (50 km) south. Founded in 1802, it was probably named for its location about midway between Dayton (approximately 20 miles [32 km] north) and Cincinnati. It soon became a lively agricultural trading community, with its products (wheat, corn [maize], tobacco, livestock, fruits, and vegetables) transported to Cincinnati and New Orleans via freight wagons, river flatboats, and the Miami and Erie Canal boats. Four railroads—the Baltimore and Ohio (originally the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton), New York Central’s Big Four, the Erie, and the Pennsylvania—arrived later. Early industrial development centred on tobacco, paper, and steel. George M. Verity built a mill (1900) that produced sheet steel by the continuous rolling process. The tobacco factories declined, but paper and steel industries have continued to flourish. Airplane and missile parts and machinery are also manufactured.

In 1804 Moravian missionaries established an Indian village called Pequotting on the site. Settlers from Connecticut arrived a few years later, and the village was laid out in 1816 by Ebenezer Merry and named for Milan, Italy. A canal was dug (1832–39) connecting the village to Lake Erie via the Huron River, and the community became a busy wheat-shipping and shipbuilding centre. The village’s refusal, however, to allow the Lake Shore and Michigan Railroad a right-of-way marked its decline as a commercial centre. Milan, now a quiet, rustic community, is the birthplace of the inventor Thomas Alva Edison (1847); the redbrick house on Edison Drive where he spent the first seven years of his life is preserved as a museum.

In the 18th century the French and British established trading posts in the area, and Fort Sandusky, which was built by the British in 1745, was burned in May 1763 during Pontiac’s War (a Native American uprising). Sandusky was a supply depot during the War of 1812; Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry’s naval victory (Sept. 10, 1813) over the British occurred about 25 miles (40 km) northwest, near Put-in-Bay. Previously known as Ogontz Place, named for an Ottawa Indian chief, the site was settled (1816) by Connecticut residents who had been awarded the land for losses suffered from British raids during the American Revolution. It was also briefly known as Portland. The present name (from a Wyandot [Wendat] Indian word meaning “cold water” or “pure water”) was adopted in 1818. The first railroad arrived in 1835.

The original settlement by James Demint and migrant Kentuckians in 1799 was on the site of the village of Old Piqua (birthplace of Tecumseh, the Shawnee chief). It was laid out in 1801 and probably named by the wife of Simon Kenton, an Indian scout who had settled there, for the springs in nearby cliffs. The arrival of the National (Cumberland) Road sustained its growth. The manufacture of farm machinery (for many years a leading industry) began there in 1855 when William Whiteley invented a successful reaper and mower. In the 1880s the journal Farm and Fireside was published in Springfield as a house organ by P.P. Mast; this formed the basis of the Crowell-Collier publishing ventures. One of the earliest programs of the 4-H Club movement of “learning by doing” for young people was started (1902) there by A.B. Graham. George Harrison Shull (born nearby in 1874) conducted his early hybrid corn (maize) experiments in Springfield, which is now the trading centre for a fertile agricultural area. Manufactures are well-diversified and include buses and heavy trucks, hoisting machinery, pumps and hydraulic equipment, metal enclosures, mops and brushes, funeral supplies, tools, and a variety of metal products. The city is the seat of Wittenberg University (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America; 1845) and Clark State Community College (1962). Inc. village, 1827; city, 1850. Pop.

Ohio"Tiffin"City"Seneca county"north-central Ohio"Tiffin, city, seat (1824) of Seneca county, north-central Ohio, U.S., located on the Sandusky River about 45 miles (70 km) southeast of Toledo. Fort Ball, a military depot of the War of 1812, occupied a site on the river’s north bank (marked by a bronze statue, The Indian Maiden), where the settlement of Oakley sprang up. (The name Oakley was changed to Fort Ball after 1824.) In 1820 Josiah Hedges founded a settlement on the south bank and named it for Edward Tiffin, Ohio’s first governor. Incorporated in 1835, Tiffin merged with Fort Ball in 1850. Agriculture was originally the economic mainstay, but the discovery of natural gas (1888) nearby brought industrial growth. Manufactures now include vitreous plumbing fixtures, furniture, automobile and machine parts, forging machinery, fabricated metal products, and insulation. Heidelberg University (formerly Heidelberg College) was founded in 1850 by the Reformed Church in the United States (now United Church of Christ), and Tiffin University, a business and liberal arts school, was founded in 1888.

Ohio"Toledo"City"Lucas county"northwestern Ohio"Toledo, city, seat (1835) of Lucas county, northwestern Ohio, U.S., at the mouth of the Maumee River (bridged). It lies along Maumee Bay (southwestern tip of Lake Erie), about 55 miles (89 km) southwest of Detroit, Mich., and is a principal Great Lakes port, being the hub of a metropolitan complex that includes Ottawa Hills, Maumee, Oregon, Sylvania, Perrysburg, and Rossford. The area was opened to white settlement after the Battle of Fallen Timbers, a conflict fought nearby in 1794 and resolved in a series of treaties negotiated with Native Americans between 1795 and 1817. Fort Industry (1803–05) was located at the mouth of Swan Creek (now downtown Toledo), where permanent settlement was made after the War of 1812. Two villages, Port Lawrence (1817) and Vistula (1832), were consolidated in 1833 and named for Toledo, Spain. The united community was incorporated as a city in 1837.[P1]Toledo Museum of ArtToledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio.Dustin M. Ramsey[ML1]Ohio’s decision to include the Toledo area (then part of the Michigan Territory) in the state’s canal system led to a bloodless 1835 boundary dispute called the Toledo War. Residents of the city organized to transfer the political jurisdiction of the lower Maumee from the Michigan Territory to Ohio. Michigan, led by Gov. Stevens T. Mason, opposed this and sent troops. Ohio governor Robert Lucas called out the militia, and the state legislature organized most of the disputed area into Lucas county, with the present Ohio line as the northern boundary. The dispute was settled by Pres. Andrew Jackson in favour of Ohio. In 1836 the U.S. Congress compensated Michigan for the loss by awarding it the Upper Peninsula and admitting it to statehood.[P2]Industrial development was spurred in the 1830s and ’40s by the arrival of the railroads, the construction of the Wabash and Erie and Miami and Erie canals, and by the discovery of local deposits of petroleum and natural gas in 1844. Glassmaking (which became a major industry) was introduced in the late 1880s by Edward Libbey and Michael Owens. Toledo is now a major commercial, industrial, and transportation centre. Its port, connected with the St. Lawrence Seaway, is one of the world’s largest for bituminous coal shipping. The port’s free-trade zone, allowing duty-free foreign trade, handles mostly grain, metal ores, machines and tools, motor vehicles, and industrial equipment. Highly diversified manufactures include glass, automobiles (including the celebrated Jeep), automotive parts, plastics, furniture and cabinets, rubber, petroleum, laundry equipment, machinery, and tools.[P3]The University of Toledo was established in 1872, Davis College in 1858, and Owens Community College in 1965. The Toledo Museum of Art has notable collections of glass, African and Asian art, and European and American painting. The city has a Roman Catholic cathedral (Our Lady Queen of the Most Holy Rosary), an orchestra, a hands-on science museum, and zoological gardens with an open-air amphitheatre.

Laid out in 1805 by Col. William Ward of Virginia, it became the county seat in the same year and grew after a training camp was established there by Gen. William Hull during the War of 1812. It was called Urbana, meaning “refinement,” or “politeness.” The coming after 1848 of the Pennsylvania, New York Central, and Erie railroads fostered industrial development. Manufactures now include plastic products, polishes, transportation lighting equipment, and farm machinery. Urbana College, based on the theology of Emanuel Swedenborg, was founded in 1850.

Ohio"Warren"City"Trumbull county"northeastern Ohio"Warren, city, Trumbull county, northeastern Ohio, U.S. It lies along the Mahoning River and is part of the Youngstown metropolitan complex. Settled (1799) by Ephraim Quinby, a stockholder in the Connecticut Land Company, it was named for Moses Warren, a surveyor. Warren became the seat of the Western Reserve, and in 1803 it was made the county seat. After the completion (1840) of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal from Pittsburgh to Akron (there connecting with the Ohio and Erie Canal), Warren developed as an inland port. The city’s prosperity grew with the discovery of coal in the Mahoning valley and the development of the local iron industry after 1870. Warren’s proximity to Youngstown and the subsequent arrival of two transcontinental highways and the Ohio Turnpike were also stimulants to growth.[P1]The city’s diversified industries now include automotive and basic steel production and the manufacture of industrial equipment and electrical products.

Youngstown is the heart of a steel-industrial complex that includes the cities of Warren, Niles, Campbell, Struthers, and Girard. The region was part of the Western Reserve until John Young, a surveyor from New York, purchased a tract of land there from the Connecticut Land Company (1797) and laid out a town (Young’s town). James Hillman, a local trader, was responsible for the early development of the community, which was organized as a town in 1802. Also in that year, James and Daniel Heaton built Ohio’s first furnace at nearby Yellow Creek to produce iron by reducing ore with charcoal and limestone. Later, it was discovered that locally mined block coal could be used directly for iron smelting. After the 1855 opening of the first Sault Ste. Marie locks, rich iron ores from the upper Great Lakes region could be transported to Youngstown and its neighbouring steel centres; subsequently, four main railroad lines and four branch lines were built to move ores and coal to Youngstown. By 1920 the city had become one of the largest steel-producing centres in the United States. Youngstown still produces steel but in much smaller quantities after some major mill closings in the 1970s; other manufactures include aluminum, tools, rubber, electronic components, plastics, office furniture and cabinets, and aircraft and automotive parts.[P1]YoungstownDowntown Youngstown, Ohio.Blue80[ML1]Youngstown State University was first established as a night school (1908).

The town was founded (1797) by Ebenezer Zane on land awarded him by the U.S. Congress for clearing a road (Zane’s Trace) through the forest to Limestone (now Maysville), Ky. Zane sold the land to his son-in-law, John McIntire, who laid out the village of Westbourne (1799; renamed Zanesville, 1801) and who was instrumental in making it the county seat (1804) and state capital (1810–12). Economic progress started with construction of the first Y Bridge (1814), the Ohio and Erie Canal (1829), and a series of locks and dams on the Muskingum (1841), opening transportation to Eastern markets. Inundating floods (1913) led Congress to authorize a network of 14 reservoirs (completed 1938) in the Muskingum valley.[P1]Zanesville: Y bridgeThe Y Bridge, Zanesville, Ohio.MauriceJFox3[ML1]The city of Zanesville is located amid abundant natural resources that include deposits of coal, natural gas, petroleum, clay, and limestone. The city’s diversified industries include the manufacture of tile, glass, electrical equipment, sheet metal, alloy steel, batteries, farm machinery, and cement products. The discovery of abundant clay deposits spurred development of the pottery industry in the region around Zanesville and neighbouring Roseville after 1890. Zanesville was for a time known as the “pottery capital of the world.” The city’s numerous pottery companies produced household objects, such as bowls and pitchers, that are still popular among collectors. Zanesville hosts an annual pottery festival (July). A branch (1946) of Ohio University and the Muskingum Area Technical College (1969) are in the city.

Cattle ranchers entered the region, and would-be settlers began to demand that it be opened for settlement. Born of the “Run of ’89,” Oklahoma City came into being on April 22, 1889, when approximately 10,000 homesteaders staked land claims near Oklahoma Station (a stop established in 1887 on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway). A provisional town government was organized at a mass meeting in May 1889, but it was not until May 2, 1890, with the organization of the Oklahoma Territory, that its incorporation became official. While the name Oklahoma City was in popular use from the city’s beginning, the U.S. Post Office did not adopt the name until 1923.[P3] The city developed as a distribution point for crops and cattle; its designation as the state capital in 1910 stimulated its growth. Meatpacking plants were established, and, with the arrival of more railroads, wholesale trade increased. Now a major transportation centre, it is the chief marketing and processing point for the state’s vast livestock industry and a shipping point for cotton, wheat, and cattle. The first oil well in the Oklahoma City pool came in on December 4, 1928. At one time about 1,400 wells were producing oil within the city limits, including some on the state capitol grounds. Although the number of wells has dropped to a few hundred, oil has remained important to the local economy.[P4]Men at oil rig, Oklahoma City.© Index Open[ML4] Through numerous annexations since 1950, Oklahoma City has become one of the country’s largest cities in land area.

The original inhabitants of the region include the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw peoples, who formed a confederation in 1855. Fur trappers visited the region in the early 1800s, and the area was settled in 1854 by J.C. Tolman, who named it Marshfield after his hometown in Massachusetts. Shipbuilding industries developed early. A sheltered harbour, proximity to large stands of timber, and the construction of sawmills in the early 1900s made the city a major lumber-shipping port. It also processes seafood, dairy, and poultry products and is the heart of a seaside resort area. Southwestern Oregon Community College was established there in 1961. Marshfield was renamed Coos Bay in 1944 and absorbed the adjacent city of Empire in 1965.

The city was laid out in 1845 and, after two of its early citizens flipped a penny, was named for Portland, Maine, rather than Boston, Massachusetts. Early growth was stimulated by a number of gold rushes and the flow of immigrants along the Oregon Trail. Portland attracted a large population of Chinese immigrants. The city’s area grew in the 1890s when it annexed surrounding communities, and the 1905 exposition celebrating the 100th anniversary of Lewis’s and Clark’s arrival brought the city national attention. Portland’s position at the junction of the Columbia River and the main north-south route from California to Puget Sound made it a valuable commercial centre handling the farm and forest produce of the Cascade Range, Willamette River valley, and Columbia River basin. The construction of deepwater port facilities capable of harbouring oceangoing vessels, the completion of the Northern Pacific transcontinental railroad, and the introduction of cheap hydroelectric power encouraged industry, and during World War II Portland was a major shipbuilding centre.

It lies along the Willamette River, 43 miles (69 km) southwest of Portland. Methodist missionaries, led by Jason Lee, settled the site in 1840. Its Kalapuya Indian name, Chemeketa, meaning “place of rest,” was translated into the biblical name of Salem (from Hebrew shalom, “peace”). A settlement was laid out in 1844, and home sites were sold by the missionaries to finance the Oregon Institute (1842), which later became Willamette University. Prospering as migration increased over the Oregon Trail, the city became the territorial capital of Oregon in 1851. The capital was briefly moved to Corvallis, but in 1864 Salem was confirmed as the state capital by popular vote. The city was an early river port whose growth was stimulated by railroad connections in the 1870s. Salem became the food-processing centre for a vast dairying, fruit, and truck-garden area; wood and light manufacturing industries also developed in the city.[P1]Salem: Oregon Supreme Court BuildingOregon Supreme Court Building, Salem, Oregon.Aboutmovies[ML1]The Neoclassical State Capitol (adjoining Wilson Park), completed in 1938, dominates Capitol Mall.

The area around The Dalles is known to have been a trading centre for Native Americans as long as 10,000 years ago and is thus one of the oldest inhabited places in North America. The region was visited by the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805. The city’s current name originated with French voyageurs who likened the basaltic rocks through which the river races to flagstones (French: les dalles). A trading post and Methodist mission were established in 1838, and Fort Lee and Fort Dalles were built during the 1840s and ’50s to protect settlers during a period of Indian uprisings and to gain control of the Columbia River and its abundant salmon. The settlement became the terminus of the Oregon Trail. The discovery of gold in the 1860s boosted the town’s growth as a trading and supply depot; for a time a federal mint was located there. With the completion in 1960 of The Dalles Dam (additional capacity was added in 1973) 3 miles (5 km) east, the city became the eastern terminal for oceangoing craft from the Pacific (200 miles [320 km] west), handling grain, fruit, lumber, meat, wool, and oil. A bridge connects The Dalles with the city of Dallesport, Washington. About 50 miles (80 km) south is the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, home to Wasco, Walla Walla (later Warm Springs), and Paiute peoples.

After the French and Indian War (1754–63), the Native American peoples lost their title to the land, and Logstown was deserted. White settlers came again in the 1770s, and sawmilling and gristmilling were early industries. During the winter of 1793–94, Gen.

Its name probably derives from the Cherokee word allatoona (“high lands of great worth”).[P1]Altoona Railroaders Memorial MuseumAltoona Railroaders Memorial Museum, Altoona, Pennsylvania.Bill Herrington[ML1]The site, long a communications focus, had been settled since the 1760s, and Fort Roberdeau (1778) was established in the vicinity to protect the local lead deposits used by the patriot army during the American Revolution. In 1787 the Frankstown Path (a trail connecting the Susquehanna and Ohio river systems) was surveyed through the area; a road was built that shortly after 1800 was extended to Pittsburgh (80 miles [130 km] west). During the canal-building boom of the 1830s, the Portage Railroad, using railroad cars to haul barges up a series of inclined planes and down the western slopes, was developed to span the 36-mile (58-km) divide between the nearby Juniata and Conemaugh rivers.[P2]Altoona’s economy is based on diversified industries and railroad shops.

The settlement was laid out in 1802 by Ludwig Eyer and was originally known as Eyersburg and Eyertown. In 1870 it was merged with Bloom township and became the town of Bloomsburg; it thus gained the distinction of being the only incorporated town in the state (all other incorporated communities are boroughs or cities). During the American Civil War, Union troops vainly searched the town for an alleged confederacy of draft evaders who had reputedly built a fort in Fishing Creek valley.

The brothers William and Maurice Wurts, who were coal prospectors, discovered coal there in 1814. Previously known as Ragged Island and Barrendale, the site was renamed Carbondale in 1822 for the successful open-pit coal-mining operations established by the Wurtses there.

Pennsylvania"Chester"City"Delaware county"southeastern Pennsylvania"Chester, city, Delaware county, southeastern Pennsylvania, U.S., on the Delaware River (across from Bridgeport, New Jersey), within the Philadelphia metropolitan area. One of the oldest communities in the state, the Chester area was granted by the Swedish crown to a bodyguard of Johan Printz, the governor of New Sweden, in 1644. After 1655 Dutch settlers joined the Swedes in establishing the town of Upland. William Markham, the deputy governor to William Penn, located his seat of government in Upland when he arrived in 1681 to establish the English colony of Pennsylvania. Upon Penn’s arrival in 1682 the province’s first assembly was convened there. Penn probably renamed the settlement Chester for a Quaker centre in Cheshire, England. From this early period, date the John Morton (c. 1650) and the Caleb Pusey (1683) houses.[P1]Chester: Caleb Pusey HouseCaleb Pusey House, Chester, Pennsylvania.Smallbones[ML1]The community stagnated after Penn moved his government to Philadelphia. During the American Revolution, Anthony Wayne took charge of and trained his troops there in early 1776, and the Battle of the Brandywine (September 1777) was fought about 10 miles (16 km) to the west. Chester did not experience substantial growth until after 1850, when it became a southwestern adjunct of a rapidly industrializing Philadelphia. The John Roach Company, founded there in 1872, was one of the nation’s first iron or steel shipbuilding enterprises. Shipbuilding remains important, though the economy has become more diversified and now includes the manufacture of chemicals and paper products.[P2]Chester is the seat of Widener University (founded 1821 in Wilmington, Delaware), and Swarthmore College (1864) is 4 miles (6 km) north.

The site was settled (1726) by John Wright, a Quaker missionary to the Native Americans, who bought land and became a ferryman and judge. Known as Wright’s Ferry, the town was laid out in 1788 by Wright’s grandson, Samuel, and was named Columbia shortly thereafter. It was one of the places considered (1790) by Congress for the site of the permanent U.S. capital. Columbia was important as the terminus of a railway from Philadelphia, and it reshipped goods by canal to the Juniata River. Escaped slaves knew it as a station on the Underground Railroad.

The town was named for the English estate (Easton) of Penn’s father-in-law, Thomas Fermor, 1st earl of Pomfret. During the French and Indian Wars, Easton was the scene of several Indian peace councils; it served as an outpost during the American Revolution, and the Declaration of Independence was read on July 8, 1776, from the steps of the Old Courthouse (a marker in the city’s “Great Square” recalls the occasion). In 1829 the Lehigh Canal from Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe) to Easton was opened, and Easton developed as a shipping centre for coal.[P2]The surrounding area is rich in natural resources—farmland, limestone, slate, iron ore, and timber. The company Binney & Smith Inc. established a factory in Easton at the beginning of the 20th century to make slate pencils but quickly began manufacturing crayons; its world-famous Crayola crayons are still made there. Other factories in the locality produce pipe couplings, plastic and paper food containers, and specialty minerals.[P3]Lafayette College in Easton was chartered in 1826, but classes did not begin until 1832.

Named for the Erie Indians, it was the site of the Fort-Presque-Isle built on the mainland by the French in 1753. Abandoned to the British in 1759, the fort was destroyed by Indians in June 1763 during the uprising known as Pontiac’s War. The area remained a wilderness until after the American Revolution, when it was purchased by Pennsylvania from the federal government. The U.S. Fort Presque Isle was built in 1795, and at the same time the town was laid out by General Andrew Ellicott, U.S. surveyor general, and General William Irvine. Naval yards established on Presque Isle Bay built most of the fleet that was used by Oliver Hazard Perry to defeat the British at the Battle of Lake Erie (September 10, 1813). Perry’s reconstructed flagship, the U.S. Brig Niagara, is berthed at the foot of Holland Street.[P1]Erie Maritime MuseumErie Maritime Museum, Erie, Pa.Pat Noble[ML1]Early industries largely supplied the region’s agricultural economy. Erie’s first iron foundries used bog ore from the bay swamps. Economic development increased and diversified with the opening (1844) of the Erie Extension (or Beaver-Erie) Canal and with railway construction in the 1850s. Manufactures are now well diversified and include locomotives, plastics, electrical equipment, metalworking and machinery, hospital equipment, paper, chemicals, and rubber products. Erie is Pennsylvania’s only port on the St. Lawrence Seaway and is a strategic shipping point for industrial coke, iron ore, steel, salt, stone, and scrap metal. It is the seat of Gannon University (1925), Mercyhurst College (1926), and the Behrend College campus of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State Erie). Presque Isle State Park on the peninsula is a popular recreation area.

The site was early occupied by the Indian village of Venango and after 1750 by forts of the French (Fort-Machault), the British (Fort Venango), and the Americans (Fort Franklin). The U.S. fort, erected in 1787, was named for Benjamin Franklin; a town, laid out and incorporated as a borough in 1795, developed around it. Franklin was the site of Pennsylvania’s third oil gusher when in 1860 James Evans, a blacksmith, dug a well for water and found oil instead. Within two years Franklin, with nearby Oil City, emerged as the hub of an oil region producing more than 2,000,000 barrels annually. The boom lasted until about 1900, when the oil-production centre shifted to the American Southwest. Among those attracted by the boom was the magnate John D. Rockefeller; John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of Abraham Lincoln, was a co-owner of one of the early Franklin wells.[P1]The petroleum industry continues to dominate the region’s economy.

The site was first settled by German Pietists led by Francis Daniel Pastorius in 1683, and the development of handicraft industries (weaving, tanning, and wagon building) led to prosperity. There William Rittenhouse built (1690) the first paper mill in the British colonies; Christopher Sower and his son established one of the colonies’ largest printing presses (1738) and printed America’s first European-language Bible (1743); and Jacob Bey, an employee of Sower, was the first colonial manufacturer of printed type. On October 4, 1777, George Washington’s Continental Army unsuccessfully fought the Battle of Germantown in an effort to break the defenses of British-occupied Philadelphia.[P1]Much of Germantown’s rich architectural heritage has been preserved. Noteworthy houses include Cliveden (1763–67; see photograph), which was planned by the jurist Benjamin Chew; Grumblethorpe (1744); Deshler-Morris House (1772–73), the home of President George Washington in the summers of 1793 and 1794; Wyck (1690); and Upsala (1798).

It was first known as Conemaugh (the old Indian name) until renamed in 1834 to honour the founder. Johnstown first became important as the western terminus of the Allegheny Portage Railroad (1831–34), a series of inclined planes whereby Pennsylvania Canal barges were transported piggyback on railway cars for 36 miles (58 km) over the Allegheny Mountains. In 1861 use of the Kelly converter (for converting iron to steel) spurred the growth of Johnstown’s steel industry, which developed the nation’s first blooming mill (used to reduce the size of steel ingots) and produced the first American-made steel rails. By 1873 Johnstown had become a leading American steelmaking centre.[P2]The city was the victim of a disastrous flood in 1889. At 3:10 pm on May 31, the South Fork Dam, a poorly maintained earthfill dam holding a major upstream reservoir, collapsed after heavy rains, sending a great wall of water rushing down the Conemaugh River valley at speeds of 20 to 40 miles (32 to 64 km) per hour. At 4:07 pm the wall of water, by then 30 feet (9 metres) high, smashed into Johnstown, which lay on the floodplain of the Conemaugh.

Pennsylvania"Lancaster"City"Lancaster county"southeastern Pennsylvania"Lancaster, city, seat of Lancaster county, southeastern Pennsylvania, U.S., and the centre of a metropolitan area comprising a number of small towns and boroughs, 71 miles (114 km) west of Philadelphia. The original site on Conestoga Creek, known as Gibson’s Pasture, or Hickory Town, was made the county seat in 1729, the year after Lancaster county (named for the English city and shire) was created. During the American Revolution, the Continental Congress, fleeing from Philadelphia, held a one-day session there (September 27, 1777), and the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania took refuge in the city for nine months in 1777–78. Lancaster was considered for the new national capital in 1790. From 1799 to 1812 it was the capital of Pennsylvania.[P1]LancasterDowntown Lancaster, Pa.Randolph Carney[ML1]The stone-surfaced turnpike from Lancaster to Philadelphia was completed in 1794. President James Buchanan lived in Lancaster, and his home, Wheatland (1828), has been restored; he is buried in Woodward Hill Cemetery. Thaddeus Stevens, Abolitionist congressman, also lived in the city; he is buried in a small cemetery amid the graves of blacks. The 18th-century Conestoga wagon (symbol of the pioneers’ trek westward) and the Pennsylvania (Kentucky) rifle were produced in Lancaster, which after the Revolution became an iron-founding centre. It was in Lancaster that F.W. Woolworth opened (1879–80) his first successful “5-and-10 cent” store. The city’s modern diversified economy is balanced between agriculture (cattle, dairy products, grain, and tobacco), services (including tourism), and industry. Manufactures include linoleum, electrical products, and farm machinery; printing is also important.[P2]In the heart of the Pennsylvania Dutch (from German Deutsch, or Deitsch, “German”) country, Lancaster’s residents include members of the Amish, Mennonite, and Dunkard churches; the Amish, in particular, are distinguished by their black, buttonless attire and avoidance of modern devices. The restored Hans Herr House (1719) is an early example of medieval Germanic architecture; it was used as a Mennonite meetinghouse. The state’s agricultural history is depicted at the nearby Amish Farm and House and the Landis Valley Museum, the latter a re-creation of a 19th century Pennsylvania German village. Franklin and Marshall College was founded in 1787, and Lancaster Bible College was founded in 1933. Also nearby is the Ephrata Cloister, site of a German monastic community that flourished in the mid-18th century. Inc. borough, 1742; city, 1818. Pop.

Settled by immigrant Germans in the 1720s, it was laid out (c. 1750) by George Steitz and was first called Steitztown. Later it was renamed for the biblical Lebanon. Its location near the famous Cornwall ore mines and other mineral deposits led to its development before the American Revolution as an iron centre. Its growth was spurred by construction of the Union Canal (1827) and the Lebanon Valley Railroad (1857).[P1]Principal manufactures include hardwood lumber products, aluminum products, and processed foods.

Opened for settlement (1754) by a treaty with the Iroquois, it was laid out in 1790 on the site of the Shawnee Indian village, Ohesson. It was one of the state’s pioneering iron-manufacturing centres and was named for William Lewis, an early ironmaster. Nearby Fort Granville was built by settlers in 1755 and destroyed the following year in the French and Indian War. Lewistown became an important shipping point with the opening of the Pennsylvania Canal in 1829.[P1]Diversified farming and manufactures (steel products, farm machinery, textiles and apparel, and metal doors) form its economic base.

Pennsylvania"Lower Southampton"Town"Bucks county"southeastern Pennsylvania"Lower Southampton, township, Bucks county, southeastern Pennsylvania, U.S., just northeast of Philadelphia. Many of the early settlers were English Quakers, who became known as the Friends of Southampton. The area was called Southampton township as early as 1685, but the township was not officially recognized until 1703. Settlers of Dutch ancestry from Long Island arrived in the 18th century.[P1]Until the early 20th century the township was rural, its close proximity to Philadelphia providing a market for agricultural products. The railroad reached the township in the 1870s, but growth did not begin in earnest until the 1920s. Thereafter, the township developed into a residential suburb of Philadelphia.

First settled about 1769 by David McKee, a ferry operator, the town was laid out in 1795 by his son John. In 1794 it was a centre of dissident activity during the Whiskey Rebellion (an insurrection against an excise tax on distilled liquors). Coal mining began in the area about 1830, but McKeesport did not develop appreciably until the basic ingredients of the steel industry (coal, iron, and railroads) coalesced in the late 19th century. It became part of the Pittsburgh industrial complex, with steel production as the dominant activity.[P1]McKeesport began experiencing considerable unemployment as the steel industries in the Pittsburgh area declined in the 1980s.

During the American Revolution the school was suspected of disloyalty, and the state assembly revoked its charter and transferred its assets to the newly created University of Pennsylvania. When Montgomery county was created in 1784, Norristown (then The Town of Norris) became the county seat. Canalization of the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers and completion of a railroad link (1834) to Philadelphia spurred the borough’s development as an industrial centre that eventually produced chemicals, machinery, metal products, plastics, steel, rubber, and textiles.[P2]Norristown’s economy now is based on service activities with some light manufacturing, machinery manufacture, product assembly, and warehousing.

A more realistic look at Philadelphia, however, shows it to be a very modern and vigorous city, arising in gracious counterpoint to the deep serenity of an older city that has provided gentle but firm intellectual, economic, and humanitarian direction to the nation at whose birth it played midwife.[P2]PhiladelphiaPhiladelphia.Donovan Reese/Getty Images[ML2] Philadelphia, the largest city in Pennsylvania, displays many characteristics of a small town. Its many trees, parks and other open spaces, and its quiet pace of life reflect in various ways the genteel Quaker heritage bestowed on the city by its founder, William Penn. Nearly everywhere are dignified reminders of the colonial and Revolutionary city and of Benjamin Franklin, a Philadelphian by adoption, who left his imprint on innumerable ongoing institutions, both cultural and commercial, in the city.[P3] Beneath this facade, however, Philadelphia represents an urban cluster of national and international stature. Its place in history was secured by its role as the location of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the constitutional convention of 1787, and second U.S. national capital. The Port of Philadelphia and Camden, one of the largest freshwater ports in the world, is the major element in the official agglomeration of Delaware River ports, collectively one of the busiest shipping centres in the world. The enormous industrial production of the city and the surrounding metropolitan area represents a continuation of Philadelphia’s early leadership in the Industrial Revolution and in American commerce and finance generally. Lying in the midst of the vast urban community stretching down the Eastern Seaboard, Philadelphia is an integral part of the vibrant fabric of contemporary social and economic life as well as a tranquil oasis joining together the spirit of America, past and present.[P4] [H3]The landscape The city site Philadelphia’s gently rolling site extends from the Delaware on the east across the Schuylkill and beyond. The coextensive boundaries of Philadelphia city and county remain essentially as defined by the Consolidation Act of 1854.[P5] The city layout The grid of streets in central Philadelphia, the first U.S. city to be so arranged, follows the original plans of William Penn. Midway between the two rivers, Penn Square, occupied by City Hall, is the centre of the plan. The building itself, opened on January 1, 1901, is one of the city’s great monuments and is the largest example of French Second Empire architecture in the United States. City Hall contains 700 rooms and 250 architectural reliefs and sculptures by Alexander Milne Calder, including a 37-foot, 27-ton statue of William Penn that stands atop the building’s main tower; the tip of his hat— almost 549 feet above ground level, or approximately 33 stories—was for some 90 years the highest point in the city, by an unwritten “gentleman’s agreement.” Four shady, fountained squares—Logan, Franklin, Washington, and Rittenhouse—dot the quadrants. Westward from Penn Square along John F. Kennedy Boulevard is Penn Center, and the long stretch of Broad Street, north and south of Penn Square, has been called the Avenue of the Arts because of its numerous cultural attractions. The multilevel complex comprises high-rise offices and hotels, with interior courts and malls and underground walkways lined with shops and restaurants.[P6]Philadelphia.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML6] Benjamin Franklin Parkway provides a splendid vista as it cuts diagonally northwestward from Penn Square through the grid, encircling Logan Square and leading into Fairmount Park. The nation’s largest landscaped park within city limits and the centre of the Centennial Exposition of 1876, Fairmount is one of the most frequent foregrounds for photographs of Philadelphia’s skyline, adding to the city’s reputation for shaded, sculpted elegance. Once a section of outlying estates of the wealthy, the park contains many fine old mansions maintained by the city as museums. Through it winds the narrow valley of Wissahickon Creek, whose rugged beauty has inspired generations of poets and painters.[P7] The oldest sections of Philadelphia—Southwark, Society Hill, and the Independence Hall area—lie to the east, along and inland from the Delaware. Southwark is the oldest, having been settled by Swedes in 1643. Those of its ancient and dilapidated houses that have escaped bulldozing for riverfront expressways resemble the edifices of Society Hill before its restoration began in the 1950s. This latter area contains some of the city’s finest old houses, taverns, and churches, though some high-rise apartment buildings strike a dissonant note in the hearts of many Philadelphians.[P8] Independence National Historical Park, established in 1956 and designated a World Heritage Site in 1979, contains Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were created, and many other buildings used by the Revolutionary and early federal governments. In 2001, the Independence Visitor Center opened in the park, and in 2003, the new Liberty Bell Center was opened to house the famous bell. Nearby, Elfreth’s Alley, dating from 1702, contains 33 houses that make up the oldest continuously inhabited street in the country. Included in the complex are Carpenters’ Hall, site of the meeting of the First Continental Congress, and Philosophical Hall, home of the American Philosophical Society. Also nearby is the National Constitution Center, which was opened on July 4, 2003, to promote the better understanding of the U.S. Constitution.[P9]Philadelphia's Liberty Bell in its new location in the Liberty Bell Center of the Independence National Historical Park.© Pablo Sanchez[ML9] Throughout these areas and elsewhere, domestic architecture is characterized primarily by two- and three-story red-brick structures fronting directly on the sidewalks and containing impressive examples of colonial design both outside and inside. The Philadelphia Historical Commission has certified about 7,500 buildings and structures, ranging from 17th-century houses to a bridge constructed in 1950. Restoration of the old but habitable has been more characteristic than wholesale demolition and rebuilding throughout most of the city. Even in its downtown section, Philadelphia continues to be a city of shops rather than of huge merchandising outlets. It has nothing approaching New York City’s Fifth Avenue as a street of large stores. Pine and other streets are noted for such specialties as antique shops, and Chestnut Street contains many smaller shops along with a Lord & Taylor department store on the site of the former Philadelphia institution, Wanamaker’s. South Street is a popular night spot with shops, restaurants, and theatres, connecting Headhouse Square, a renovated colonial market place, and Penn’s Landing.[P10] For most of the 20th century the major features of the skyline were the massive contours of the city’s many banking and financial institutions. In 1987, a change was signalled by the completion of the first of a number of new skyscrapers that redefined the skyline of Philadelphia and formed part of the construction boom that took place during the 1990s and early 2000s.[P11] The long stretches of Philadelphia north, south, and west of the intersection of Broad and Chestnut streets, a city hub of sorts just below Penn Square, contain numerous distinctive sections, often identified for generations with various ethnic groups that have filled the city during its long history. Among the more interesting is the Germantown section of North Philadelphia, settled in Penn’s time by Germans and the home in the 18th century of wealthy Philadelphians fleeing the periodic yellow-fever epidemics of the riverside city. North Philadelphia has a large African American and Puerto Rican community. South Philadelphia contains sections, notably Italian and Irish, settled by European immigrants mainly in the 19th century as well as a large African American section.[P12] [H4]The people Though Philadelphia has had most of the characteristics of an ethnic and racial melting pot nearly from its start, it lacks the steaming hurly-burly visible everywhere in its behemoth neighbour, New York City, about 90 miles (150 km) northeast. Philadelphians by and large are not a street people, and their orientation has been so traditionally toward the home that the city became known as a “city of homes.” Philadelphians are also great joiners, giving the city more social and other clubs than any other in America. Many of these are based in ethnic neighbourhoods, others are city wide, and still others serve the affluent “Main Liners” who reside in the plush suburbs that grew up in past centuries along the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak).[P13] Much of this tradition dates from Philadelphia’s early years, from the beliefs and attitudes not only of the Quakers but also of such German pietist sects as the Mennonites, who stressed personal religious experience rather than institutionalized formulations. A basic sobriety underlying these tenets led to many stringent laws that remain in both the city and state. On the other hand, these groups strove for tolerance in all matters. Pennsylvania was among the few colonies admitting Roman Catholics and Jews, and the Quakers long were leaders in seeking justice and the alleviation of inhumanity in racial and other human relations. Philadelphia still has innumerable small, endowed charities of Quaker origin to provide the poor with fuel or food—as well as one of the oldest and strongest municipal commissions on human relations.[P14] During the 1800s the Protestant sects were joined by Roman Catholics, initially Irish and German and later Italian, Polish, and Slavic. Eastern European Jews also immigrated, eventually comprising a significant portion of the city’s population. Cultural conflicts and competition for housing and jobs created tensions between the old stock groups and the new arrivals. A series of anti-Catholic nativist riots rocked Philadelphia in the Jacksonian period, with an especially violent riot in 1844; Catholics gradually gained acceptance, and two Philadelphia Catholics, the immigrant St. John Neumann and the native born St. Katharine Drexel, were canonized. Although immigrants came to Philadelphia in the hundreds of thousands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city had a relatively low proportion of foreign-born when compared with other major cities at that time. Some Irish, Italian, Polish, and Jewish newcomers did find opportunities for considerable economic advancement in Philadelphia; for many, however, hopes never materialized and progress toward full acceptance was slow.[P15]Lithograph of the riot in Philadelphia in 1844 between Catholics and non-Catholics in which nine people were killed, scores injured, and two Catholic churches burned to the ground.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML15] Philadelphia has been the focal point of one of the historically most important black communities in the nation. During the early national and antebellum periods, many black leaders came from or centred their activities in Philadelphia, and the free black community there was intensely involved in many efforts to abolish slavery, assist fugitive slaves, and advance the general social and economic well-being of blacks. In 1833, the American Anti-Slavery Society was organized in the city. Between 1829 and 1860, however, the Philadelphia black community was victimized by several antiblack mob actions. At the beginning of the 20th century Philadelphia was the site of the largest black community of any northern city. The migration of Southern-born blacks to the city continued to augment the city’s black population throughout the first half of the 20th century. Discrimination in housing resulted in the creation of overcrowded black districts, but activists including the Rev. Leon Sullivan, perhaps best known for the Sullivan Principles and work against apartheid in South Africa, struggled to overcome these problems. By the late 20th century about 40 percent of all Philadelphians and well over 50 percent of the public school population were black. The suburbs, by contrast, were about 95 percent white.[P16] [H5]The economy Industry Many of Philadelphia’s business enterprises were established in the 1700s, but the city’s economy has changed greatly. Such old and once-dominant industries as textile mills met stiff competition from the South and from abroad. Industry was given a boost by World War II but began to decline later; thousands of jobs were lost in the 1960s. Nonmanufacturing and service industries, however, continue to increase employment and now dominate the economy. High-technology industries such as communications, computer software, and Internet commerce became important in the late 20th century. Printing and publishing and food processing are major factors in the modern economy. Manufactures include chemicals, industrial machinery, fabricated metal products, electronics, transportation equipment, scientific instruments, apparel, paper products, rubber and plastic products, and primary metals. A decline has been evident in the migration of both people and businesses from the city to the suburbs. The Valley Forge area, best known as a Revolutionary War historic site, has become a nest of business and industrial locations. Much of this relocation is under the sponsorship of the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation.[P17] One of the mainstays of the economy in Philadelphia and much of eastern Pennsylvania from before the birth of the nation was the naval yard, which employed tens of thousands of workers in its prime. Ship building emerged as an important part of the economy in the late 18th century, and the Continental Congress commissioned five ships from Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War. A naval shipyard was opened in 1801 by an act of Congress of 1799, and the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard became one of the most important production sites for the navy. During World War II some 50 new ships were built there and hundreds more were repaired. Ship production continued over the next several decades, but the navy’s needs changed, and the duties of the yard gradually turned to repair and overhaul. In 1991, the Defense Base Closure Commission recommended that the shipyard be closed, and the yard received its final commission, which was completed in 1995. The yard closed in 1996. Efforts were made to keep the yard going even before it closed, and in 1997 an agreement was reached with a major Norwegian shipbuilder. Ship production began again in 2000, and the first ship built at the new Kvaener Philadelphia Shipyard was completed on March 2003.[P18] Research George Washington approved the first U.S. patent in 1790, to a Philadelphian named Samuel Hopkins for a better way of making potash. In today’s economy research and invention are keys to progress. In West Philadelphia is located the Science Center, a nonprofit project of more than 30 academic and scientific institutions with a multimillion-dollar commitment to research. Dupont, Rohm and Haas, and Lockheed Martin are other large concerns with extensive research programs within the metropolitan area. The region is one of the country’s largest health education and research centres; several major biotechnology companies, many specializing in pharmaceuticals, have research facilities there. A major milestone in the computer age was born out of experiments at the University of Pennsylvania, where the ENIAC computer was launched in 1945. A unit of the Boeing Company at Ridley Park is one of the world’s most advanced plants for helicopter research and design.[P19] The unique Food Distribution Center, a nonprofit corporation managed by a board of directors representing city government and private enterprise, is a prime example of how Philadelphia has joined the work of the private and public sectors to serve the best interests of both. Covering more than 400 acres (160 hectares), it is a food-industry park handling in a unified operation every food-marketing facility from ripening bananas to smoking fish; it is composed of more than 100 stores plus warehousing and processing plants.[P20] Finance From its early days until the 1850s, Philadelphia was the financial capital of the United States, but it lost this position to New York City. It was the birthplace of American banking, and the first building and loan association was founded there. Philadelphia also supplies the stock and exchange services demanded by modern business. The Philadelphia Commercial Exchange was set up in 1868 as an outgrowth of the older Corn Exchange Association of 1863 to regulate the then-flourishing grain and flour trade. The Philadelphia Bourse was organized in 1891, and the Maritime Exchange was founded in 1875. Philadelphia has the oldest stock exchange (founded in 1790) in the United States. The Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Exchange was joined by Pittsburgh in 1969 and in 1976 was renamed the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. A U.S. Mint is located within the city.[P21] Transportation One of the first subway systems in the United States was established in the city in 1907 and remains a centrepiece of public transportation in Philadelphia. A complex system of public and private trolley and bus lines was consolidated in 1963 by the state legislature’s creation of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) to plan, develop, and coordinate a regional transportation system and to fund projects by the sale of bonds. Express buses provide rapid service between the inner and outer city. A high speed rail line connects Philadelphia with nearby communities in New Jersey and a ferry and rail line link the city with the renovated waterfront in Camden, New Jersey.[P22] A joint New Jersey–Pennsylvania bridge commission operates 7 toll and 13 tax-supported bridges over the Delaware north of the city. Two of these are solely for pedestrian use. The Schuylkill is bridged at a number of points and has a subway tunnel. The Delaware River Port Authority administers the Ameriport Intermodal Rail Facility, the Port of Philadelphia and Camden, a ferry service, the PATCO high-speed transit line, and the Benjamin Franklin, Walt Whitman, Betsy Ross, and Commodore Barry bridges over the Delaware. The authority has also carried out major improvement and expansion programs throughout the entire port area. Philadelphia International Airport is less than 7 miles (11 km) from the city centre.[P23] [H6]Administration and society Government The city-county consolidation in 1854 was a result of the inability of a colonial-type government by committees to adapt to the needs of a growing city for new public services, e.g., better streets, police, transportation, sanitation, and schools. Ironically, Philadelphia had, in fact, led most cities in providing urban improvements, but they were too few and too slow, and the breakdown of law and order in the 1840s forced changes. Until the early 1950s the standard type of U.S. city government prevailed in Philadelphia, comprising an elected mayor and a city council elected from among candidates presented by the political parties in the political divisions, or wards. As in other large cities, this form was subject to pressures for special favours, such as street-railway franchises and public-works contracts; bribery and corruption were both inevitable and rampant.[P24] The reform movement that began in 1939 was joined in 1948 by top business and financial leaders, who organized the Greater Philadelphia movement, and together they took up the battle for an entirely new city charter. This document effectively removed the city council from its administrative role and increased the staff and powers of the mayor. A strong civil-service commission improved professional employment. The council, 7 of whose members were elected by all the voters and 10 by districts, was to review and approve taxes and budgets and enact ordinances. Philadelphia thus had the first modern big-city charter in the United States; its approval by a two-to-one popular vote made it an expression of the desire of Philadelphians for better, more efficient, and honest city government.[P25] The first mayors under the new charter were Joseph S. Clark and Richardson Dilworth, men devoted to making it work. From wealthy Republican families, both were lawyers who revolted against the corruption and inefficiency of city government and became Democrats. Men of the highest qualifications were selected for key positions, planning was made a virtue, and a $150,000,000 plan was launched at once for improvements in sewerage and sanitation, playgrounds, lighting and streets, police and fire protection, and other basic services long neglected. The ambitious plan for a Penn Center involved removal of the old Pennsylvania Railroad “Chinese Wall” of overhead tracks, which ran into the heart of the city at Broad Street, and replacing it and the Broad Street Station.[P26] Renewal planning gave close attention to the need for better housing. The Philadelphia Housing Authority and the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority, with federal and private aid, approached Philadelphia’s housing in terms of improving neighbourhoods rather than total clearance followed by new high-rise apartments. Affected areas included the Independence Hall area, neighbouring Society Hill, and the historic waterfront.[P27] Municipal services Though the Philadelphia metropolitan area has a per capita income that is the highest of any such area in the state, a large percentage of Philadelphians live below the poverty level. City, state, and federal agencies administer a full range of ameliorative social-service programs. A department of public health operates a variety of services through a number of health districts. With its Quaker tradition, Philadelphia is known for its humanitarian concern and has a great variety of privately supported child-care, hospitals, and other social services.[P28] Education Philadelphia’s public school system is an independent governmental unit operating under a board of education appointed by the mayor on the recommendation of a citizens’ nominating panel. Private education is well represented in the city and includes numerous Roman Catholic and Quaker Friends schools. The city and surrounding area boast one of the highest concentrations of institutions of higher learning in the country, and the most prestigious of these institutions is the privately endowed University of Pennsylvania, which was founded in 1740, opened the nation’s first medical school (1765), and was the first designated “university” in the United States (1779). Temple University (1884) has acquired the reputation of “the people’s college” and is known for work in the arts and social sciences. Among the many Roman Catholic colleges and universities are LaSalle University and St. Joseph’s University. Drexel University is the region’s premier institution of technology and engineering and maintains one of the largest cooperative education programs in the country. Liberal arts colleges such as Haverford (1833), Swarthmore (1864), and Bryn Mawr (1885), as well as Villanova University (1842) are located in the suburbs. Philadelphia is also a centre for medical education, with several general schools and specialized schools in pharmacy, podiatry, optometry, and osteopathy. The Curtis Institute of Music (1924) is a leading music school, while the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (1805) is the oldest art school in the United States.[P29]Pennsylvania, University ofFisher Fine Arts Library, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.WatchmikeDrexel UniversityThe College of Information Science and Technology, Drexel University, Philadelphia.ImmortalGoddezz[ML29] Page 1 of 2 Next page Cultural life
Pennsylvania"Phoenixville"Town"Chester county"southeastern Pennsylvania"Phoenixville, borough (town), Chester county, southeastern Pennsylvania, U.S., on the Schuylkill River between French and Pickering creeks, 28 miles (45 km) northwest of Philadelphia. The site was originally settled in 1720 by the Reverend Francis Buckwalter, a German refugee, and the town was founded (1731) by his followers. It marked the most westerly point reached by the British in Pennsylvania during the American Revolution. The steel industry dates from around 1785, beginning with Benjamin Longstreth’s unsuccessful iron forge. Other forges, including Lewis Wernwag’s Phoenix Iron Works (1812), which gave the borough its name, were established. In 1856 John Griffen, superintendent of the Phoenix Iron Works, turned out the first Griffen gun (a light cannon), later used by the Union army during the American Civil War.[P1]Phoenixville: Phoenix Iron WorksRestored foundry of the Phoenix Iron Works, now home to the Schuylkill River Heritage Center, Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.J Clear[ML1]Service industries now dominate the local economy, and the borough is mainly residential.

The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British built Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the Ohio. Settlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief Pontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John Campbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following the American Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River.[P2] Pittsburgh’s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city’s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the “Iron City.” The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire.[P3]Wall, William C.: View of the Great Fire of PittsburghView of the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, oil on canvas by William C.

Rosenbloom, 74.7.28Bessemer converters in operation at a steel mill, 1886, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML3] After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh’s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881.[P4] By 1900 the city’s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power.[P5]Map of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S. (c. 1900), from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML5] [H3]The contemporary city By the late 1970s and early ’80s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared—a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste by unemployment. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industries—though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained important—and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and the service sector became increasingly important. Pittsburgh long has been one of the nation’s largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportation centre.[P6] Much of the Golden Triangle has been rebuilt and includes the Mellon Arena, Point State Park (containing Fort Pitt Blockhouse and Fort Pitt Museum), the Gateway Center (site of several skyscrapers and a garden), and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The University of Pittsburgh was chartered in 1787. Other educational institutions include Carnegie Mellon (1900), Duquesne (1878), and Point Park (1960) universities, Chatham (1869) and Carlow (1929) colleges, and two campuses of the Community College of Allegheny County (1966).[P7]Duquesne UniversityStudent Union, Duquesne University, Pittsburgh.Alekjds[ML7] Central to the city’s cultural life is the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (formerly Carnegie Institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. Its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the Carnegie Science Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and the Andy Warhol Museum (1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburgh-born artist and filmmaker. Other institutions affiliated with the organization are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 million volumes, and the Carnegie Music Hall.

Pennsylvania"Pottstown"Town"Montgomery county"southeastern Pennsylvania"Pottstown, borough (town), Montgomery county, southeastern Pennsylvania, U.S., on the Schuylkill River, 37 miles (59 km) northwest of Philadelphia. The region’s first iron forge (known as Pool) was erected there (1716) by Thomas Rutter, and the Coventry forge produced the first commercial steel in Pennsylvania in 1732. The town, laid out in 1753 by John Potts (an ironmaster whose father, Thomas, had been associated with Rutter), was known as Pottsgrove until 1815, when it was incorporated as a borough and the present name adopted. Arthur St. Clair lived there when he was elected president of the Continental Congress (1787). The iron industry had produced an economic boom by the 1880s.[P1]Pottstown: Pottsgrove ManorPottsgrove Manor, Pottstown, Pennsylvania.Willjay[ML1]Pottstown is now the trading centre for a farm, dairy, and industrial region with manufactures including auto parts, plastic products, and dies; food processing is also important.

Pennsylvania"Pottsville"City"Schuylkill county"east-central Pennsylvania"Pottsville, city, seat (1851) of Schuylkill county, east-central Pennsylvania, U.S. It is situated at the gap of the Schuylkill River through Sharp Mountain, on the southern edge of the Pennsylvania anthracite-coal region, 35 miles (56 km) northwest of Reading. The first settlers were massacred (1780) by Indians; other settlers arrived in 1800 and became engaged in iron production. John Pott, for whom the city was named, acquired and expanded the iron works shortly after his arrival in 1806 and laid out the town in 1816. With the discovery of coal in the vicinity, Pottsville became a boom town. In the 1860s and ’70s it was a rallying point for the Molly Maguires, a secret miners’ society that struggled to improve mining conditions, often with violent methods; a trial in Pottsville (1877) resulted in six hangings and numerous prison sentences of suspected members of the society.[P1]Following the decline of the coal industry, the manufacture of textiles, aluminum and steel products, and plastic film and containers became the city’s economic mainstay. American novelist John O’Hara was born there and reportedly used Pottsville as the model for Gibbsville in Appointment in Samarra (1934) and other works. America’s oldest brewery still in operation, the Yuengling Brewery, was established in Pottsville in 1829. Inc. borough, 1828; city, 1911. Pop. (2000) 15,549; (2010) 14,324.[P2] [END-OF-CONTENT]
Pennsylvania"Reading"City"Berks county"southeastern Pennsylvania"Reading, city, seat (1752) of Berks county, southeastern Pennsylvania, U.S., on the Schuylkill River, 51 miles (82 km) northwest of Philadelphia. Laid out in 1748 by Nicholas Scull and William Parsons on land owned by Thomas and Richard Penn (sons of William Penn, Pennsylvania’s founder), it was built around Penn Common, a large open square, and named for the hometown of the Penn family in Berkshire, England. During the American Revolution, Reading served as a supply depot and manufacturer of cannon.[P1]ReadingReading, Pa.[ML1]Industrial growth began in the late 18th century with the development of the iron and steel industries in Berks county. After the production of upper Great Lakes ore overshadowed that of Pennsylvania ore, Reading shifted to the fabrication of iron and steel. The opening of the Schuylkill Canal to Philadelphia (1824) and the Union Canal to Lebanon and Middletown on the Susquehanna River (1828) and the completion of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (1884) greatly stimulated industrial growth. In the 1890s, safety-bicycle manufacturing mushroomed. Development of the textile and hosiery industry was started about 1900 by two German technicians, Ferdinand Thun and Henry Janssen, who installed the first braiding and knitting machine in the country. In 1974 Reading became the site of the world’s first multi-tenant manufacturers’ outlet (opened by women’s lingerie manufacturer Vanity Fair), and outlet stores and malls continue to play a prominent role in the local economy. In the early 21st century, local industries included electronic components, batteries, specialty steels, energy-storage technology, and medical devices.[P2]The Reading area is the seat of Albright College (1856), Alvernia University (1958), Kutztown University (originally Keystone State Normal School, 1866), and the Berks campus (1958) of Berks–Lehigh Valley College of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State Berks). Mount Penn (1,300 feet [396 metres]), with a red-and-gold pagoda (1908) and a stone observation tower (1939) at its summit, is the centre of a city park. Local historic landmarks include the Daniel Boone Homestead (where Boone was born in 1734), the Conrad Weiser Homestead (1729), and Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site near Pottstown. An annual folk festival at nearby Kutztown reflects the Pennsylvania Dutch (German) heritage of the area.[P3]Officially designated “Baseballtown” in 2002 by local authorities, the Greater Reading area has a long history with the American national pastime that dates from the formation of the Reading Athletic Club in 1858. Minor league professional baseball has been played on and off in Reading since the late 19th century, and the Reading Fightin Phils of the Eastern League have been an affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies since 1967—currently the longest continuous association between a Major League Baseball team and a “farm club.” The city also has a minor league ice hockey team.

Pennsylvania"Scranton"City"Lackawanna county"northeastern Pennsylvania"Scranton, city, seat (1878) of Lackawanna county, northeastern Pennsylvania, U.S., in the Lackawanna River valley, on the western fringes of the Pocono Mountains. It is the centre of an urbanized industrial complex that includes Carbondale and Wilkes-Barre.[P1]ScrantonScranton, Pa.Don Liotta[ML1]The area was inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Munsee Indians (a subgroup of the Delaware) when white settlers entered the region in the mid-18th century. Permanent settlement of the valley dates from 1788, when it was known as Deep Hollow. In the next few years a gristmill, a sawmill, and a charcoal furnace were built along the Lackawanna, but there was little development. The village was called Unionville, Slocum Hollow, and Harrison before it was named Scrantonia and finally Scranton in 1851 in honour of the family that established the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company there in 1840. George W. and Selden Scranton began smelting iron from local ores, using an anthracite hot-blast process. The venture was successful, and by 1850 a rolling mill, a nail factory, and a steel-rail works were in operation. Subsequent development of the anthracite-coal industry overshadowed the iron industry and brought in waves of immigrant miners, whose wives were skilled in the silk-weaving, clothing, and other industries. Scranton is noted for its production of Nottingham lace.[P2]With the decline and later demise of the coal industry from the 1950s, the city diversified its economy and received national recognition for its “Scranton Plan,” which provided jobs through industrial expansion. Community contributions and private and state aid financed construction of many new plants. Leading manufacturers now produce electronic equipment and metal products. The city is also a printing centre and a transportation hub with access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike.[P3]Higher education facilities include the University of Scranton (Roman Catholic; 1888), Marywood University (founded as Marywood College; 1915), Lackawanna Junior College (1894), and a branch campus (1921) of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State Worthington Scranton) in nearby Dunmore. The state school for the deaf and the International Correspondence Schools are also in Scranton.

Pennsylvania"Shamokin"City"Northumberland county"Northumberland county"Shamokin, city, Northumberland county, east-central Pennsylvania, U.S. It lies along Shamokin Creek. Founded in 1835 by the coal speculators John C. Boyd and Ziba Bird, it was early known as Boyd’s Stone-coal Quarry, Boydtown, and New Town. The present name, selected by Boyd, is a derivation of one of two Delaware Indian words, one meaning “place of eels” and the other “where horns are plentiful.” Shamokin developed as an anthracite coal-mining centre, reaching its peak after the 1840s. It suffered extensive fire damage in 1872.[P1]Following the decline of the coal industry, the city’s economy diversified to include the manufacture of textiles, shoes, kitchen cabinets, and cellulose products. By the late 20th-century, however, there was little manufacturing left in Shamokin; service industries, including a state prison just outside of the city, had become the economic mainstay. Pop.

He named the town for John Wilkes and Isaac Barré, British politicians who were defenders of the American colonies in Parliament. The community survived the Pennamite-Yankee Wars, fought (1769–84) between Pennsylvania and Connecticut settlers over rival land claims, and conflicts with the Tories and Iroquois Indians, which culminated in the slaughter of settlers in the Wyoming Massacre (July 3, 1778) during the American Revolution. The punitive American expedition of 1779, led by General John Sullivan against the Iroquois, was formed at Wilkes-Barre. Further trouble between warring settlers occurred, but by 1805 Connecticut had relinquished all its claims.[P2]The major growth of the community came with the development of the coal industry in the early 19th century, which brought transportation facilities and an influx of European immigrants. Coal mining waned from the 1930s, and the city developed a highly diversified economy with manufactures including glass, boilers, toys, steel fabrications, airplane parts, and electronic equipment, including semiconductors.

Following a schism in that settlement, a group led by William Coddington moved to the southern end of the island and established Newport, which, because of its excellent harbour, soon became one of the most flourishing seaports in colonial North America. From 1640 to the 20th century, however, the two towns shared a government. Its early merchants prospered in the triangular trade of rum, molasses, and slaves between New England, Africa, and the West Indies. Printing in Rhode Island was begun at Newport in 1727 by James Franklin, an older brother of Benjamin. In 1758 James Franklin, Jr., established the Newport Mercury, which is still published as a weekly newspaper.

The area, settled in 1641 as Kings Towne, was incorporated in 1674; in 1686–89 it was called Rochester. In 1722–23 it was divided into North Kingstown and South Kingstown. North Kingstown includes the villages of Allenton, Davisville, Hamilton, Lafayette, Quonset Point, Saunderstown, Slocum, and Wickford (the administrative centre).[P1]Early economic activities were textile milling, fishing, farming, and boatbuilding. Industrial tools and machinery are now major manufactures. Davisville was the home of the Atlantic Seabees (naval mobile construction battalions) between 1942 and 1991, when the base was closed. The acreage made available by the decommissioning of the Naval Air Station at Quonset Point in 1974 has been developed as an industrial park. The Quonset Air Museum is housed in a brick hangar at what is now Quonset State Airport. Lafayette has state fish hatcheries.[P2]Wickford is the site of the Old Narragansett Church (1707) and of Smith’s Castle at Cocumscussoc (1678), used as a rendezvous for settlers who fought the Narragansett Indians in the Great Swamp Fight (1675; a battle in King Philip’s War).

In the heart of the business district, the river plunges some 50 feet (15 metres) over a mass of rocks; the city’s name is from an Algonquian word for “at the falls.” First settlement on the site was made in 1671 by Joseph Jencks, Jr. His smithy, destroyed by Indians in 1676 during King Philip’s War, was rebuilt, and soon the village became a centre for ironmongers. In 1793 Samuel Slater built the first successful waterpowered cotton mill in North America (now restored and designated a national historic landmark), an event considered to be the start of the Industrial Revolution in America. Pawtucket has a highly industrialized economy; metals, jewelry and silverware, and specialty textiles are produced.[P1]PawtucketPawtucket, Rhode Island.Marc N.

It was founded in 1638 by William Coddington, John Clarke, Anne Hutchinson, and associates from the Massachusetts Bay colony and was first called Pocasset, an Algonquian word referring to the width of the river. The Portsmouth Compact, by which the settlers established a democratic government, is inscribed on a bronze and stone marker at Founder’s Brook. The settlement was incorporated as a town in 1640 and was probably renamed for Portsmouth, England; in that year it also entered into an agreement to share government with Newport that lasted to the 20th century. During the American Revolution the British general Richard Prescott was captured on July 9, 1777, by William Barton at Overing House in Portsmouth. Butts Hill Fort (remnants exist) was the scene of a delaying action by American forces during the Battle of Rhode Island (1778).[P1]Now an outlying suburb of Newport city, Portsmouth includes the villages of Bristol Ferry and South Portsmouth and the islands of Prudence and Patience in Narragansett Bay.

A seaport and an industrial and commercial centre, it is the focus of a metropolitan area that includes Pawtucket, East Providence, Central Falls, Cranston, Warwick, and Woonsocket. It was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams, who had been banished from Massachusetts Bay colony for his unorthodox religious beliefs. Williams and five dissenter companions, after canoeing along the Moshassuck River to what is now called College Hill, found a freshwater spring. From the Narragansett Indian sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi he purchased the surrounding land, which he named for “God’s merciful providence.” The settlement’s growth, halted by King Philip’s (Indian) War (1675–76), was given impetus in 1680, when Pardon Tillinghast built a wharf that became a base for the thriving triangular trade in molasses, slaves, and rum between Africa, the West Indies, and the American colonies.[P1]ProvidenceProvidence, R.I.© Laura Stone/Shutterstock.comMap of Providence (c. 1900), from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Read More on This Topic Rhode Island The capital is Providence. READ MORE Providence played an important role in the American Revolution; it had its own “Tea Party,” at which tea was burned in protest against taxation. Forts were built in the town, and American and French troops were quartered in what is now University Hall (built 1770; restored 1940) at Brown University. The Old State House (1762) was the scene of the signing of the Rhode Island Independence Act (May 4, 1776) two months in advance of the country’s own Declaration of Independence. In the post-Revolutionary period Providence’s sea trade quickly recovered. By the late 19th century it was supplemented by industrial activity, which today includes the manufacture of machinery and machine tools, jewelry, plastics, electronic equipment, and rubber goods. Providence remains a busy seaport and is a distributing point for oil, natural gas, lumber, steel, and chemicals.[P2]Providence was incorporated as a city in 1831 and became sole capital of Rhode Island in 1900, after having shared the duty first with four other towns and from 1854 with Newport. The city contains much of historic interest. The names of many streets (e.g., Benefit, Benevolent, Hope, Friendship, Dubloon, India, Packet, and Ship) are reminders of the community’s early search for religious toleration and of its maritime commerce. Other colonial landmarks include the Meeting House of the First Baptist Church (1775), the oldest Baptist church in the United States; the Market House (1773); and the John Brown House (1786), a Georgian-style mansion and national historic landmark. The First Unitarian Church (1816) has the largest bell cast by Paul Revere.[P3]Educational institutions include Brown University (founded in 1764 in Warren as Rhode Island College, moved to Providence in 1770, and renamed in 1804 for Nicholas Brown, its principal benefactor), Johnson and Wales University (1914), the Rhode Island School of Design (1877), Rhode Island College (established in 1854 as Rhode Island State Normal School), and Providence College (1917, Roman Catholic). The Museum of Art of the Rhode Island School of Design has collections of American decorative arts and European paintings. The Providence Athenaeum (1838) houses a collection (established 1753) of old books and paintings. The State House (1895–1900), built of white Georgia marble, has a dome measuring 50 feet (15 metres) in diameter. The city has two cathedrals, SS. Peter and Paul (1874–89, Roman Catholic) and St. John (1810, Episcopal).[P4]Severe damage was caused by a hurricane and storm surge in 1938, and, as a protection, the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier was completed in 1966.

Its turbulent reputation as a lawless outpost of frontier violence was magnified by the Deadwood Dick series of dime novels. Wild Bill Hickok, soldier, scout, and marshal, was killed in a Deadwood saloon on August 2, 1876, by Jack McCall. Hickok is buried in Mount Moriah Cemetery, near Calamity Jane, Preacher Smith, Seth Bullock, and other celebrated frontier characters who died in the vicinity; the reenactment of Hickok’s killing and the capture and trial of McCall is a popular tourist spectacle. A railroad link was completed in 1891, and Deadwood became a regional trading centre. Gambling was central to Deadwood’s history, but it was prohibited in 1905; gaming in Deadwood was again legalized, through a state referendum, in 1989.[P2]The economy is driven largely by tourism, based primarily on dozens of gaming halls (many with Old West themes). Some ranching and lumbering also take place in the area. Deadwood is surrounded by Black Hills National Forest and has many outdoor recreational opportunities, including snowmobiling and skiing. The city itself is a national historic landmark. The Adams Museum has exhibits on local history, and the Broken Boot Gold Mine allows visitors to pan for gold and tour a historic underground mine.

South Dakota"Hot Springs"City"Fall River county"southwestern South Dakota"Hot Springs, city, seat (1882) of Fall River county, southwestern South Dakota, U.S. It lies along the Fall River in a canyon walled by red rocks, in the southern Black Hills, about 50 miles (80 km) south of Rapid City. Sioux and Cheyenne Indians were once frequent visitors to the area’s warm mineral springs, which were reputed to have healing properties. Settled in 1879 as Minnekahta (a Sioux word meaning “Hot Waters”), it was renamed Hot Springs in 1882 and developed as a health resort. A large natural-warm-water indoor pool built in 1890, the Evans Plunge, remains a tourist attraction. The city’s economy depends on ranching, tourism, and a veterans home and medical centre. The Mammoth Site, discovered in 1974, is a sinkhole that entrapped dozens of mammoths and other animals some 26,000 years ago. The bones have been left where they were found, and ongoing excavations can be observed by visitors. Wind Cave National Park and Custer State Park are a few miles north and Angostura Dam, Reservoir, and Recreation Area a few miles southeast. Hot Springs is bordered to the west and south by Black Hills National Forest. Buffalo Gap National Grassland, of which Hot Springs is a district headquarters, is to the south and east. Also in the area are Badlands National Park and Jewel Cave National Monument. The Black Hills Wild Horse Sanctuary, about 15 miles (25 km) south of the city, is a refuge for wild mustangs. Inc. 1882.

Established in 1880 as a division headquarters of the Chicago and North Western Railway, it was named for the Huron Indians and developed as an agricultural centre.[P1]The city’s economy depends primarily on diversified agriculture (including corn [maize], wheat, soybeans, sunflowers, hay, cattle, and hogs). Manufactures include metal doors, construction equipment, electronics and electrical equipment, and novelty items. The economy is augmented by tourism in the pheasant-hunting season (which includes the annual Ringneck Festival in November) and by the South Dakota State Fair, held there annually in late summer. A popular attraction is the “World’s Largest Pheasant,” a steel and fibreglass structure that stands 30 feet (9 metres) tall. Dakotaland Museum contains exhibits on local history; another attraction is the home (1894) of Gladys Pyle, the first woman elected to the South Dakota legislature and the first Republican woman elected to the U.S. Senate. Huron is the location of the family pharmacy of the U.S. senator and vice president Hubert H. Humphrey (1911–78).

South Dakota"Lead"City"Lawrence county"western South Dakota"Lead, city, Lawrence county, western South Dakota, U.S. It lies in the northern Black Hills, about 40 miles (65 km) northwest of Rapid City, at an elevation of 5,280 feet (1,609 metres). Situated just southwest of Deadwood, it is built on the steep inclines of the hills. It was established in 1876 following the discovery of gold by Fred and Moses Manuel, and its name was inspired by the lode mines in the area, an outcrop of ore being termed a “lead.” Lead was South Dakota’s largest city at the time of statehood in 1889. The city lost a major aspect of its economy with the closing of the Homestake Gold Mine (opened 1876), which was the world’s oldest continuously operating gold mine until it closed in 2001; chemist Raymond Davis received the 2002 Nobel Prize for Physics for his work in detecting neutrinos in a laboratory in the mine. Tourism, based primarily on the more than 80 gambling halls in Deadwood (where gambling was legalized in 1989), is now an economic mainstay. Some ranching and lumbering also take place in the area. Lead is surrounded by Black Hills National Forest and has many outdoor recreational opportunities, including two ski areas. The Black Hills Mining Museum has a simulation of an underground gold mine.

South Dakota"Madison"City"Lake county"southeastern South Dakota"Madison, city, seat (1873) of Lake county, southeastern South Dakota, U.S. It lies about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Sioux Falls. In 1870 settlers William Lee and Charles Walker arrived in the area and named it for Madison, Wisconsin, which was near their previous home. The community was laid out on Lake Madison in 1875 after having been chosen as county seat two years earlier. In 1880 the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad passed through a homestead that lay about 5 miles (8 km) northwest, and the residents of Madison and nearby Herman moved their towns to that site. Dakota State University was founded there in 1881 as the first teacher-training school in the Dakota Territory. The university is a primary factor in the city’s economy. Area agriculture is based on corn (maize), soybeans, and poultry; manufactures include farm implements, road-maintenance equipment, wood cabinets, snowmobile parts, custom homes, plastics, and signs. Immediately west is Prairie Village, which features pioneer buildings and memorabilia and serves as the site of the annual Steam Threshing Jamboree (August), with its antique farm equipment show.

Sioux Indians inhabited the area when settlers began arriving in 1877. The community was founded in 1880 with the arrival of the railroad. Originally called Milbank Junction—for Jeremiah Milbank, director of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad—it later had its name shortened. Milbank’s economy depends on agriculture (including dairy products, livestock, corn [maize], soybeans, wheat, rye, and oats), granite quarrying, business services, insurance, telemarketing, warehousing, and food processing.

South Dakota"Mitchell"City"Davison county"southeastern South Dakota"Mitchell, city, seat (1874) of Davison county, southeastern South Dakota, U.S. It lies in the James River valley near Firesteel Creek (there dammed to form Lake Mitchell), about 70 miles (110 km) west of Sioux Falls. Arikara and, later, Sioux Indians were early inhabitants of the area. Settlers arrived at the confluence of the James River and Firesteel Creek in 1872 in anticipation of the coming of the railroad. The railroad was eventually located about a mile west of the town site, which was then called Firesteel because it lay on the floodplain; in 1879 a new town site was platted, and Firesteel was moved. It was renamed for Alexander Mitchell, president of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad. The railroad link was completed in 1880. Mitchell’s economy today is based on tourism (particularly during the pheasant-hunting season, from October to December), manufacturing (including trailers, packaging, truck parts, toner, metal products, and industrial fans), food processing, and agriculture (corn [maize], soybeans, livestock, and dairying). The Corn Palace (built 1921, replacing an original built in 1892 and a second built in 1905) is a unique Moorish structure decorated annually with corn, grain, and grasses and distinguished by minarets and domes. The Mitchell Prehistoric Indian Village preserves the archaeological site of a 1,000-year-old Native American village and includes artifacts and a reproduction earth lodge. The Dakota Discovery Museum contains an art gallery, restored buildings, and artifacts. Also of interest is the Enchanted World Doll Museum, which features several thousand dolls. Annual summer events include the Corn Palace Stampede rodeo, the Corn Palace Festival, and Dakotafest (a farm show). Mitchell is the seat of Dakota Wesleyan University (1885).

Arikara and, later, Sioux Indians were early inhabitants of the area. Settlers began to arrive in the late 19th century, and the site was chosen as the Missouri River crossing point for the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad. Telegraph transmissions from the Missouri bridge site were marked with the abbreviation “MO Bridge,” and this gave the community its name. With the arrival of the railroad in 1906, sales of land on the town site began. Mobridge developed as an agricultural trade centre, and it remains the commercial centre for a large surrounding cattle-ranching and agricultural (wheat, oats, barley, sunflowers, and corn [maize]) region. Tourism is a major economic factor; fishing for walleye and hunting of pheasants are especially popular outdoor recreational activities. The grave of the Sioux chief Sitting Bull and a monument to Sacagawea, who was a guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–06), are across the river, near where the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux reservations merge. The Scherr-Howe Arena has murals by Oscar Howe, a Sioux artist, and the Klein Museum displays Native American and pioneer artifacts. The Sitting Bull Stampede (July) is an annual rodeo. Mobridge is located on the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, and several recreation areas (Lake Hiddenwood, Indian Creek, and Swan Creek) are nearby.

South Dakota"Pierre"City"Hughes county and capital"of Hughes county and capital of South Dakota"Pierre, city, seat (1880) of Hughes county and capital of South Dakota, U.S. It lies on the eastern bank of the Missouri River, in the geographic centre of the state.[P1]South Dakota State CapitolState Capitol, Pierre, South Dakota.Glen Allison/Getty Images[ML1]Arikara and, later, Sioux Indians were early inhabitants of the area, which was visited by the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804. The first permanent settlement was a fur-trading post built in 1817 on the western side of the river. Pierre was founded in 1880 as the western terminus of the Chicago and North Western Railway and named for Pierre Chouteau, Jr., a fur trader and entrepreneur. Growth was spurred by its position as a railhead for the mining industry and as a trade centre for a large area, including prosperous farming and cattle country. In 1889, when South Dakota became a state, Pierre was named the temporary capital; in elections in 1890 and 1904, it was chosen the permanent capital.[P2]The capitol building (1905–10) is on a 115-acre (47-hectare) tract that includes the governor’s mansion (1937), the Flaming Fountain (veterans’ memorial), several other memorials, the Cultural Heritage Center (1989; headquarters for the South Dakota State Historical Society), and a 5-acre (2-hectare) artesian-fed lake. Oahe Dam (1948–62)—a power, irrigation, recreation, and flood-control project 5 miles (8 km) north of Pierre—has impounded the 231-mile (372-km) Lake Oahe along the Missouri River between Pierre and Bismarck, North Dakota. Fort Pierre, across the river, was the fur-trade capital of the Northwest from 1832 to 1855; a monument there marks the place where Louis-Joseph and François Vérendrye buried a lead plate in 1743 (found in 1913) claiming the region for France. Other attractions in Pierre include the South Dakota Discovery Center and Aquarium and the South Dakota National Guard Museum. Fishing is popular in the area. Pierre is located on the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. Lower Brule and Crow Creek Sioux reservations are southeast of the city; the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation is northwest. Fort Pierre National Grassland is to the south. Farm Island, West Bend, Okobojo Point, and Cow Creek recreation areas are also nearby.[P3]Government and services are the basis of Pierre’s economy, and the city is a regional trade centre.

South Dakota"Rapid City"City"Pennington county"western South Dakota"Rapid City, city, seat (1877) of Pennington county, western South Dakota, U.S. It lies at the eastern edge of the Black Hills on Rapid Creek, from which it derived its name.[P1]It was settled in 1876 during the Black Hills gold rush. In the beginning the community grew slowly, and there was often discord between the settlers and the Sioux. Rapid City soon became a transportation centre and the eastern gateway to the mining region, and the railroad arrived in 1886. Today the city is a regional centre of commerce, culture, transportation, education, and health care. Tourism is the basis of the economy. Forestry and mining (gypsum, clay, sand and gravel, and crushed stone) are also important. Manufactures include electronics, wood products, cement, and jewelry. The area’s main agricultural activities are cattle and sheep ranching; wheat, oats, and hay are also produced. Financial and business services, beef processing, and distribution are other economic factors.[P2]Rapid City is the seat of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (founded 1885) and National American University (founded 1941). The Journey Museum combines several collections in exhibits on pioneer history, the Sioux, and regional archaeology and geology. The Museum of Geology, on the mining school campus, includes displays of minerals and dinosaur skeletons found in the area. Reptile Gardens has one of the largest collections of reptiles in the world. Bear Country USA is a drive-through wildlife park with bears, bison, mountain lions, elk, wolves, and bighorn sheep. Ellsworth Air Force Base is located just northeast of the city; on its grounds is the South Dakota Air and Space Museum. A popular annual local event is the Central States Fair (August).[P3]Rapid City is located in an area of tourist attractions and public lands, including Badlands National Park and Buffalo Gap National Grassland to the southeast and Black Hills National Forest, Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Custer State Park (noted for its herd of bison) to the west and southwest.

South Dakota"Sioux Falls"City"Minnehaha county"southeastern South Dakota"Sioux Falls, city, seat (1868) of Minnehaha county, southeastern South Dakota, U.S. It lies on the Big Sioux River, near the Iowa and Minnesota state lines.[P1]Sioux FallsSioux Falls, S.D.Alexius Horatius[ML1]Sioux Indians occupied the area when the town site, which was named for the falls of the river, was founded in 1857 by land speculators. In 1862 the conflict between the Sioux and the settlers in southwestern Minnesota spilled over into Sioux Falls, and the town was abandoned and burned. Fort Dakota was established on the site three years later, and settlers began to return. The arrival of the railroad in 1878 contributed greatly to population growth; today the city is headquarters of the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad Corporation and the Iowa, Chicago & Eastern Railroad Corporation. Quarrying and polishing of rose quartzite, found throughout the region and used for monuments and construction, was an important industry in the 1880s. Financial problems and a plague of grasshoppers caused an economic downturn in the 1890s, but improvements began in the early 20th century, including the opening of a meatpacking plant in 1909. Because of the laxity of South Dakota divorce laws, Sioux Falls was famous (c. 1890–1910) as a place to get an easy and quick divorce. One of the world’s first commercial nuclear power plants operated in the area during 1966–67.[P2]The city, by far the largest in the state, is a regional trade, distribution, and health care centre. Cattle sales at its stockyards—once among the world’s busiest—ended in 2009, but meat processing remains a major industry. Other agriculture in the region includes corn (maize), soybeans, and dairy products. Sioux Falls is a major centre of credit-card operations and other financial services, an industry that began with the arrival of one large corporation in the early 1980s and now comprises several companies. Manufactures include computers and computer parts, plastics, electronics, packaging labels, cabinets, window parts, and painting equipment. Sioux Falls Regional Airport is the state’s largest.[P3]Educational facilities include Augustana College (1860), the University of Sioux Falls (1883), North American Baptist Seminary, Kilian Community College (1977), Southeast Technical Institute (1968), and a centre (1992) combining educational programs from Dakota State University, South Dakota State University, and the University of South Dakota. The state penitentiary and a school for the deaf are also in the city. The Washington Pavilion of Arts and Science (1999) is the home of the South Dakota Symphony Orchestra and also includes art galleries, theatres, and a science centre. The Great Plains Zoo, located in Sherman Park, is the site of the Delbridge Museum of Natural History. Regional history is preserved in the Old Courthouse (1893) and the Pettigrew Home (1889). The Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) Data Center, an information-processing centre that serves as an archive for geographic data obtained from satellites, aircraft, and cartographic surveys, is about 15 miles (25 km) north of the city.

Sioux Indians lived in the area when it was established in 1876 as a gold-mining camp. It was named for Spearfish Creek, which runs through the city and was so named by the Sioux because they speared fish there. It developed as an agricultural centre with irrigated farmland producing fruits and vegetables and the creek providing power for sawmills and flour mills. It gained a reputation as a quiet community, in contrast to the roughness of other Black Hills towns of the time. A railroad, established in 1893 to haul ore from the mines, soon became a scenic attraction, but it was destroyed by flooding in 1933. Tourism, based primarily on outdoor recreation in the Black Hills and in scenic Spearfish Canyon, is a major economic factor. Lumbering, the production of wood products and electronics, cattle and sheep ranching, and health care and educational services are also important. The city is the seat of Black Hills State University (founded 1883). Since 1938 the Black Hills Passion Play has been presented annually during the summer in an outdoor amphitheatre west of the city, against a backdrop formed by Lookout Peak.

Fort Vermillion, a trading post, was built on the site in 1835, and a permanent settlement was established in 1859. Norwegian and Swedish immigrants settled in the region to farm. A flood in 1881 nearly destroyed the city, which consequently was rebuilt higher on the bluffs. Its name is derived from the river, which in turn comes from the red (vermilion) clay along the river’s banks. The city is the seat of the University of South Dakota (established in 1862 and opened in 1882). Vermillion’s economy is based primarily on the university. The city is a distribution centre for snowmobiles, and the manufacture of pressure-washing equipment also contributes to the local economy. Area agriculture includes corn (maize), soybeans, and livestock. The National Music Museum preserves rare and antique musical instruments. The Austin-Whittemore House (1882) and the W.H. Over Museum (1883) preserve local cultural and natural history. Spirit Mound, a few miles north of the city, was visited by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on their 1804–06 expedition; the Sioux believed it to be inhabited by small hostile warriors.

It was laid out in 1878 following the extension of the Winona and St. Peter Railroad (now part of the Union Pacific Railroad Company) and was named for Watertown, New York. An earlier settlement, called Kampeska City, was abandoned in 1874 after grasshoppers destroyed the crops. The economy of Watertown is based largely on the manufacturing of high-technology electronic and magnetic components. Other manufactures include construction equipment and parts, rubber products, signs, welding equipment, and hydraulic and mechanical tubes. Turkey processing is also important. Area agriculture produces dairy products, cattle, poultry, soybeans, corn (maize), wheat, oats, and rye. Tourism, mostly in the form of outdoor recreation on area waterways, contributes to the economy. A casino operated by the Sioux is just north of the city. Watertown is the seat of Lake Area Technical Institute (1965).

Chattanooga is a headquarters for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) power system, which since the 1930s has been an important element in its economic growth.[P1]Tennessee RiverThe Tennessee River, Chattanooga, Tenn.TheCustomOfLife[ML1]The site was settled about 1815 when John Ross, who was later made a Cherokee chief, established a trading post (Ross’s Landing) on the river. In 1838 it was renamed Chattanooga, derived from a Creek word for nearby Lookout Mountain meaning “rock rising to a point.” The settlement developed initially as a river port, and its growth was stimulated by the arrival of the railroads in the 1840s and ’50s.[P2]Map of Chattanooga, Tenn., c. 1900 from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML2]Chattanooga was a strategic Confederate communications point during the American Civil War and was a major objective of the Union armies. Fighting there culminated in the decisive battles of Chickamauga Creek and Chattanooga (September and November 1863, respectively), after which Union forces occupied the city and used it as a supply centre for the Atlanta campaign of General William Tecumseh Sherman. The city’s historic environs have been preserved in Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park (established 1890), which encompasses about 13 square miles (33 square km) over several locations in Tennessee and Georgia. The park includes the major battlefields and sections on Orchard Knob, Lookout and Signal mountains, and Missionary Ridge. Chattanooga National Cemetery in the city has the graves of James J. Andrews’s Union raiders, who became famous for stealing the Confederates’ wood-burning locomotive The General.[P3]Iron and steel mills were built there after the war to exploit area mineral resources. By the late 1960s air pollution had become a major problem, but over the next 25 years a successful cleanup effort turned the situation around. Chattanooga’s economy is now highly diversified. Production of electricity by the TVA, services (including health care, education, and government), insurance, and transportation (trucking) are major factors. Manufactures include processed foods, appliances, carpet, yarn, metal products, asphalt, boilers, fire hydrants, and engines. Chattanooga is also a popular tourist destination and convention site.[P4]The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga dates from 1886; other educational institutions include Southern Adventist University (1892) at nearby Collegedale, Chattanooga State Technical Community College (1965), Tennessee Temple University (1946), and Covenant College (1955) at nearby Lookout Mountain, Georgia. The city’s cultural assets include a symphony and opera association, community theatre, ballet, and the Hunter Museum of American Art. The Tennessee Aquarium, opened in 1992, is the world’s largest freshwater aquarium. Among the city’s unusual attractions are the National Knife Museum, the International Towing and Recovery Hall of Fame and Museum, and the Siskin Museum of Religious Artifacts.[P5]A steep incline railway ascends Lookout Mountain, inside of which is a cave containing Ruby Falls, a 145-foot (44-metre) waterfall; at the top of the mountain are a swinging bridge and odd stone formations known as Rock City.

Founded as the seat of newly created Maury county in 1807, Columbia developed as an agricultural centre in a region of fertile farmland. It survived floods and earthquakes in its early years. James K. Polk, 11th U.S. president, moved to Columbia as a child from North Carolina; he began his law practice there in 1820, and his home is now a historic site. Columbia soon became a centre of mule trading; beginning about 1840 a livestock market, one of the largest in the world at that time, was held there. An official celebration of the mule trade, including the Mule Day Parade, began in 1934 and has been held annually in the spring since 1974. During much of the American Civil War the city was an operations base for the Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest, and it was occupied alternately by Union and Confederate troops.

Established in 1802 on an overland stagecoach route, it was named for the biblical Lebanon, which had a profusion of cedar trees, because the area’s stands of juniper were mistaken for cedars by the early settlers. It developed as a trading centre for livestock and farm products. Lebanon was the scene of several minor skirmishes during the American Civil War, mainly during 1862.[P1]Lebanon: Cumberland UniversityCumberland University, Lebanon, Tenn.Ichabod[ML1]Beef cattle and tobacco are important to the economy; manufactures include appliances, automotive parts, luggage, and rubber products.

French (1739) and Spanish (1795) forts briefly existed on the site, and in 1797 the United States built Fort Adams there. Memphis was founded in 1819 on land previously inhabited by Chickasaw Indians. Andrew Jackson, later U.S. president, was one of its founders. Memphis was named for the ancient Egyptian city (meaning “Place of Good Abode”).[P2] Memphis grew rapidly with the expansion of cotton growing in the South and because of its transportation facilities by railroad and river. It was incorporated in 1826. A Confederate military centre early in the American Civil War, it was captured by a Union gunboat force on June 6, 1862, and remained occupied until the end of the war. One of the country’s worst race riots took place there in May 1866.[P3] Memphis subsequently became a centre of trade for the South’s cotton. In the 1870s yellow fever devastated the city, killing more than 5,000 residents. The city went bankrupt, declined in population, and in 1879 surrendered its charter. Drastic sanitary reforms, continued cotton trading, and the growth of a market in hardwood contributed to its economic recovery, and a new city charter was granted in 1893. Economic development was accelerated after World War II. During the 1960s the civil rights movement greatly affected the city. On April 4, 1968, civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., visiting the city in support of a sanitation workers’ strike, was killed on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel by a sniper’s bullet. The motel became the National Civil Rights Museum in 1991; exhibits trace the history of the civil rights struggle, and King’s room is preserved.[P4]Goods stacked along a Mississippi River levee at Memphis, Tennessee, for shipment, 1897.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.Lorraine Motel, Memphis, Tennessee; site of the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.Carol M.

Its international airport is the world’s second busiest cargo airport (after Hong Kong’s), and the city is among the nation’s largest inland river ports. Extensive rail and highway facilities and the headquarters of major freight corporations contribute to the importance of the industry. Memphis is a major world cotton market and a world leader in hardwood trading and processing and soybean processing. The city serves an agricultural area noted for livestock, cotton, soybeans, corn (maize), feed grains, and forest products and has agricultural research and food processing industries. It is an important wholesale centre. Manufactures include electronics, medical products and equipment, and paper products. Services (including health care, banking and finance, government, and education), tourism and convention business, and high-technology industries also contribute to the economy. Educational institutions in Memphis include Rhodes College (1848; Presbyterian), LeMoyne-Owen College (1871), Christian Brothers University (1871; Roman Catholic), University of Memphis (1912), Southwest Tennessee Community College (established in 2000 by the merger of the State Technical Institute at Memphis and Shelby State Community College), Memphis College of Art (1936), and the health science centre of the University of Tennessee.[P5]Memphis, University ofStudent Plaza, with Scates Hall (left) and Michael D.

Handy’s home is preserved as a museum, and modern Beale Street is a popular entertainment district, with nightclubs, restaurants, shops, live music, and other attractions. B.B. King also occupies a central place in the history of the blues in Memphis. A blues festival is held annually in August, and other events throughout the year celebrate the city’s musical heritage. Memphis has also been called the birthplace of rock and roll. Elvis Presley was one of many musicians who launched careers from Memphis’s Sun Studio. After Presley’s death in 1977, his city mansion and burial site, Graceland, became a shrine (opened to the public for tours in 1982). Memphis made a huge contribution to the development of soul music as well, with Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, and Al Green being just a few of the significant soul artists who recorded in Memphis or called it home.[P6]Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee.Martin HaaseMemphis, Tennessee: Beale StreetBeale Street in Memphis, Tennessee.© Anthony Aneese Totah Jr/Dreamstime.com[ML6] Memphis has a symphony orchestra, ballet troupe, and opera company, as well as several theatre organizations.

French fur traders established a post known as French Lick on the site in 1717. A force behind the area’s settlement was Richard Henderson, a North Carolina jurist who in 1775 acquired most of middle Tennessee and Kentucky in the Transylvania Purchase from the Cherokee. In 1779 he sent a party under James Robertson to investigate the Cumberland Valley. They settled at French Lick and were joined in the spring of 1780 by another group under John Donelson. Fort Nashborough, built at the site and named for American Revolutionary War general Francis Nash, became the centre of the new community. (A replica of the fort stands in a park along the Cumberland River.) Henderson is also credited with having written the Cumberland Compact, the articles of self-government adopted by the settlers. The community was renamed Nashville in 1784.[P2] Chartered as a city in 1806, Nashville developed as a river trade depot and manufacturing site for middle Tennessee and became the political centre of the state. Its commercial importance was further enhanced by the advent of the railroads in the 1850s. Nashville was occupied by Union troops in February 1862, and the last major American Civil War battle (December 15–16, 1864) took place outside the city, when Union forces under Gen. George H. Thomas defeated the Confederates under Gen. John B. Hood.[P3]Fortified Union railroad bridge across Cumberland River, Nashville, Tenn., 1864. Photograph by George N.

(LC B8171-2629 LC)[ML3] Nashville’s recovery after the war was spurred by its central location in the region’s rail and water transport networks, although it experienced serious cholera epidemics in 1866 and 1873. The city became known for the many institutions of higher education that were founded there and was given the nickname “Athens of the South.” Nashville’s economy and population grew rapidly in the first decades of the 20th century, and it was also during that time that the city emerged as the centre of American traditional and country music. Regular radio broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry, a program of such music, began in Nashville in 1925 and continue today. Nashville’s industrial development accelerated in the 1930s after cheap electric power became available from the Tennessee Valley Authority and from dams on the Cumberland River. However, when it flooded after a two-day downpour in May 2010, the Cumberland brought damage to large parts of the city and took a number of lives.[P4] [H3]The contemporary city The modern economy is diversified. The music and entertainment industry is a primary factor, and services such as health care, finance and insurance, and education are major contributors. Manufacturing (including automobiles, automobile glass, trucks, tires, water heaters, aircraft parts, and appliances), printing and publishing (especially music and religious materials), and tourism are also important. The city’s central location, combined with an international airport, port facilities on the Cumberland, and rail and highway connections, make it a distribution and transportation centre. Agriculture in the region includes tobacco, livestock, dairy products, corn, and soybeans.[P5]Skyline and Cumberland River at dusk, Nashville.Jerry Driendl—Taxi/Getty Images[ML5] Nashville is known worldwide for country music, which is the basis of a large recording industry in the city. Much of that activity is clustered in an area of downtown called Music Row. The city has dozens of tourist attractions related to music, including the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the Ryman Auditorium, a concert venue that was once the home of the Opry. Grand Ole Opry radio shows can be seen in person at the Opry House, which is part of a complex including a hotel and shopping venues located east of downtown.

After 1940, however, extensive irrigation from underground water increased agricultural output.[P2]In addition to oil, farming, and ranching, the city has a large copper refinery and ordnance and helicopter factories. Helium is found in large quantities in the area, and Amarillo is the site of a major helium plant; the six-story stainless steel Helium Time Column Monument was erected in 1968 to commemorate the element. Another unusual monument, lying just west of town, is the Cadillac Ranch, where 10 vintage Cadillac automobiles stand upright, their noses encased in concrete.[P3]Art installation of half-buried Cadillac automobiles, Cadillac Ranch, near Amarillo, Texas, U.S.Carol M.

Texas"Arlington"City"Tarrant county"northern Texas"Arlington, city, Tarrant county, northern Texas, U.S., between Fort Worth (west) and Grand Prairie and Dallas (east). Caddo Indians, the first known settlers in the region, were the victims of westward expansion. An early white settlement (1840), on an Indian council site, was called Bird’s Fort. Continuing disputes between Indians and would-be settlers ultimately led to the Battle of Village Creek (1841), in which more than 200 Indian lodges were burned and the Caddo routed. The Republic of Texas in 1843 signed a peace treaty with nine Indian tribes at what is now Arlington. The city itself was laid out by railroad men in 1876 and named for General Robert E. Lee’s home in Virginia.[P1]Arlington: Rangers BallparkRangers Ballpark, Arlington, Texas.Dopefish[ML1]Once known for its cotton ginning and agricultural products, Arlington is primarily an industrial and commercial centre; it has automotive and aerospace industries that developed after 1950, with an accompanying rapid increase in population. It is the seat of the University of Texas at Arlington (1895) and the Arlington Baptist College (1939). Six Flags Over Texas, a large amusement park, is located there, and the city is home to the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball and the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League.

In 1839 it was selected by scouts as the site for the permanent capital of the Republic of Texas and renamed to honour Stephen F. Austin, father of the republic. By 1840 Austin was incorporated, with 856 residents. When Mexican invasion threatened Texas in 1842, the government moved to Houston, but the town’s citizens, determined to keep Austin the capital, staged the so-called Archive War, forcibly retaining government records. The government returned to Austin in 1845, the year in which Texas was admitted to the United States. Austin’s pink granite State Capitol (1888), modeled after the U.S. Capitol, succeeded an earlier structure (burned 1881).[P2]Austin, TexasPlan of the city of Austin, Texas, 1839.Courtesy of Texas State Library & Archives CommissionAustin, TexasLithograph of Austin, Texas, c. 1840.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML2] The city flourished as a trading centre for ranchers and farmers after the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad and the construction of a permanent bridge across the Colorado River in 1871. A flood in 1900 caused widespread destruction, including the collapse of the bridge. With the harnessing of the river for flood control and power in the early 20th century, industry began to develop. Austin experienced dramatic growth during the 1990s, fueled mainly by high-technology industries.[P3]Texas State CapitolTexas State Capitol, Austin.© Comstock Images/Jupiterimages[ML3] [H3]The contemporary city Business, research and development, and manufacturing concerns involving computers, computer equipment, semiconductors, telecommunications, software, and biotechnology are among the city’s major employers. Government, education, and health care services are also primary economic factors. Railroads play an important role in trade, with most international cargo traveling to international ports by rail. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport opened in 1999 on the site of a former U.S. Air Force base.[P4]Austin, TexasSkyline of Austin, Texas.© AbleStock.com/Jupiterimages[ML4] The city’s population is ethnically diverse. Less than half of its people are of European descent, more than one-third of the population is Hispanic, and African Americans and Asian Americans each constitute slightly less than one-tenth of the population. Austin’s educational resources, particularly the University of Texas (1881), which has its main campus there, have contributed to growth. Other educational institutions include Huston-Tillotson College (1875), St. Edward’s University (1885), Concordia University at Austin (1926), and Austin Community College (1972).[P5]Austin, TexasAustin, Texas.© Photos.com/Jupiterimages[ML5] At dusk, portions of the central city are lighted by “artificial moonlight” from mercury vapour lamps atop 17 165-foot (50-metre) tall towers (erected in 1894). The O. Henry Home and Museum is housed in what was O. Henry’s residence from 1893 to 1895, and the Elisabet Ney Museum, situated in her former studio, houses a collection of Ney’s sculptures; Ney created many life-size figures, including those of Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston standing in the national and state capitols. The French Legation Museum (1841) was built by French chargé d’affaires Alphonse Dubois de Saligny, who was to represent the French government in the Republic of Texas; if he occupied the house at all, it was probably for a very short period. The Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum (1971), situated on the campus of the University of Texas, contains archives, documents, and memorabilia of Johnson’s public career. The Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum (2001) showcases exhibits on the state’s history. The Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art, on the university campus, has a notable collection of Latin American art. Other facilities include the Austin Museum of Art, the Mexic-Arte Museum, and the Umlauf Sculpture Garden & Museum. The city supports an array of cultural organizations including a professional symphony orchestra, an opera company, and a ballet troupe, as well as a variety of art galleries and theatre groups.[P6] Austin is known for its vibrant music scene. Formerly a centre of country and blues music, it now celebrates a variety of genres including rock, folk, jazz, and Latino music. More than 100 live music venues are centred primarily around the Warehouse District and Sixth Street, and a long-running public television series, Austin City Limits, showcases musical talent. Dozens of local recording studios and record labels make significant economic contributions. The South by Southwest Conference, devoted to music, film, and interactive media, is held each year in March. The city is also a favourite moviemaking location, and it is home to many artists associated with music and film.[P7]South by SouthwestA crowd gathering outside a South by Southwest event at the Paramount Theater in Austin, Texas, 2012.© John Pesina/Shutterstock.com[ML7] Annual festivals celebrate the ethnic groups that have contributed to the city’s culture, such as Mexicans, African Americans, Germans, and French. The Star of Texas Fair and Rodeo is held each spring. Austin’s Congress Avenue Bridge is renowned for its population of Mexican free-tailed bats; sightseers are attracted to the hundreds of thousands of bats that fly from their roosts on summer nights. Mount Bonnell, at 785 feet (239 metres), is one of the city’s highest points and features a 99-step climb to the top. Zilker Park extends along the river and is the site of a nature centre, botanical gardens, and Barton Springs, a natural swimming pool. McKinney Falls State Park is in the southern part of the city.[P8] The Hill Country west of Austin, dotted with charming small towns that were originally settled by mostly central European immigrants in the 19th century, is a recreational region with the chain of Highland Lakes (including Town Lake and Lake Austin, which wind through the city) impounded by dams along the Colorado River. Unusual rock outcrops, caverns, and springs are found in the area.[P9] [END-OF-CONTENT]

The area was settled in 1822; in 1864 a Confederate shipyard was built at Goose Creek. The unincorporated community of Baytown was annexed by Pelly (incorporated 1920) in 1945; in 1948 Pelly and Goose Creek (incorporated 1919) were consolidated to form the present city of Baytown. Oil (discovered locally in 1916) is shipped from docks on the Houston Ship Channel at Baytown, which has oil refineries, petrochemical and synthetic-rubber plants, and steel-plate mills. Lee (community) College (1934) is located in the city. The Baytown Nature Center—created after 1983, when Hurricane Alicia destroyed the city’s Brownwood subdivision—is an official stop on the Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail. Houston Raceway Park outside of Baytown is a major drag racing venue for the National Hot Rod Association and hosts a number of racing events, featuring monster trucks, motorcycles, and race car events.

Rothenberger[ML1]In 1824 Noah Tevis founded the settlement of Tevis Bluff; in 1835 he sold 50 acres (20 hectares) of land for a town site to Henry Millard, who supposedly named it Beaumont for his wife’s family. Lumbering, rice cultivation, and shipping were early activities, and in the 1890s five railroads came through the site. Spindletop, the first major oil field in Texas, was discovered nearby when the Lucas Well blew in 1901, and a boom city sprang up. After the completion of a deep-river channel in 1916, Beaumont became a key port of the Texas petrochemical industry with large oil refineries and shipbuilding, grain storage, and rice-processing facilities. Salt and sulfur domes are also worked in the area. The Lucas Gusher Monument and the reconstructed Gladys City–Spindletop Boomtown commemorate the oil strike; the Spindletop–Gladys City Museum is operated by Lamar University (1923). The Texas Energy Museum also celebrates Beaumont’s role in the development of the Texas oil industry. Other institutions of note within the city are the Art Museum of Southeast Texas, the McFaddin-Ward House Museum and Carriage House, the Babe Didrikson Zaharias Museum, and the Edison Plaza Museum.

Texas"Brownsville"City"Cameron county"extreme southern Texas"Brownsville, city, seat (1848) of Cameron county, extreme southern Texas, U.S. It lies along the Rio Grande opposite Matamoros, Mexico, 22 miles (35 km) from the river’s mouth. With Harlingen and San Benito it forms an industrial, agribusiness, and port complex.[P1]On March 28, 1846, General Zachary Taylor placed the U.S. flag on the site (then part of Matamoros) and constructed a fort. Taylor’s arrival signaled the start of the Mexican War, which began in earnest after the Thornton Skirmish (April 25, 1846). On May 8 and 9, 1846, the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma were fought there. The fort was later named Fort Brown for Major Jacob Brown, who died in battle on May 9. During the American Civil War, Brownsville and Matamoros served as ports of call for blockade runners handling guns and ammunition and for Confederate cotton, and on May 12 and 13, 1865 (a month after the war had ended), a Union force was captured at nearby Palmito Hill by Confederates under General Richard Taylor. In the postwar years, Fort Brown served as a military hospital; there William Gorgas, a physician, conducted pioneering research on the treatment of yellow fever. The fort was decommissioned in 1945.[P2]Modern Brownsville got its start when the first standard-gauge railroad arrived from Kingsville in 1904. The city was the scene of the Brownsville Affair of 1906, in which black soldiers were unjustly accused of murdering a white man and wounding another. Ethnic tensions, especially between Anglo Americans and Mexicans, plagued the city throughout the 20th century.[P3]Brownsville’s deepwater port (opened 1936), with a 17-mile (27-km) channel, serves as the southwestern terminus of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and handles a range of bulk cargoes, including fuel oil, ores, and grains; it is also the harbour for a large shrimp fleet. Brownsville’s industries include petrochemicals, aircraft repair, and food processing. The city is an international air, highway, and rail focus and is the largest urban centre in the irrigated lower Rio Grande valley, which supports the raising of cotton, grain, winter vegetables, citrus fruit, and livestock.[P4]Brownsville’s economy is augmented by tourism, based on the nearby Boca Chica Beach, the Padre Island National Seashore (established 1962), and gateway facilities to Mexico. The city’s annual pre-Lenten Charro Days festival combines Texan and Mexican culture.

Palo Duro Canyon (about 120 miles [200 km] long) was carved by the main channel of the Red River, aided by rains and wind erosion; it has ravines that plunge 1,000 feet (300 metres), exposing multicoloured rock strata covering 300 million years of four geologic ages. The canyon was the scene of the last great Indian battle in Texas (1874) when U.S. cavalry under Colonel R.S. Mackenzie routed a camp of Comanches who had left their reservations. Charles Goodnight, the famed Texas cattleman, later established his Old Home Ranch nearby.

Other settlers moved into the region, and a town site was laid out in 1844. The origin of the community’s name is uncertain; most likely it is named for early settler Joseph Dallas or for George Mifflin Dallas, vice president (1845–49) of the United States. Its early settlement was augmented by Swiss and German immigrants and in the late 1850s by French artisans from the unsuccessful Fourierist utopian colony at nearby La Réunion. Large numbers of African Americans moved into the area after the American Civil War.[P2] Commercial growth was stimulated by the arrival of the railroads in the 1870s. A huge wholesale market developed, with many of the city’s retail stores serving the American Southwest; one, Neiman-Marcus, has become internationally known. The adjacent communities of East Dallas and Oak Cliff were annexed in 1889 and 1903, respectively, greatly expanding the city’s size.[P3] Locally produced grain, leather, and especially cotton (grown in the black-clay fields around Dallas) fed the city’s early growth and were followed by insurance and, later, oil. The Dallas Cotton Exchange was organized in 1907 and in the early decades of the 20th century was one of the world’s largest cotton markets. In addition, the city was a top manufacturer of cotton-ginning machinery. Also during the early 20th century, Dallas was a centre of food processing and the manufacture of textiles and leather products, and an automobile plant and a branch bank of the Federal Reserve System were established there. Mexican immigrants contributed to the population growth. In 1930 C.M. (“Dad”) Joiner discovered the great East Texas oil field, which attracted investment and made the city a major centre of the petroleum industry. Dallas’s Central Centennial Exposition (1936), the state’s official observance of the Texas revolution centennial, was a boon to the city’s Depression-era economy, and one of the country’s first shopping centres opened in 1931 in the suburb of Highland Park.[P4] The city began a period of spectacular growth during and after World War II, when several large aircraft-manufacturing plants were established in the area. These were followed by electronics and automobile-assembly plants. Dallas was thrust abruptly into the international spotlight on November 22, 1963, when U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated as he rode in a motorcade through the downtown area. Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport opened in 1974, drawing business to the region and making it an attractive location for corporate headquarters. The oil business reached its peak in the early 1980s; however, by the end of the decade the industry had gone bust, and thereafter its contribution to the economy decreased dramatically. In 1987 Annette Strauss became the city’s first elected female mayor, and in 1995 the first African American mayor, Ron Kirk, was elected.[P5] [H3]The contemporary city Dallas today is a cosmopolitan city known for its high concentration of restaurants and shopping centres. Skyscrapers, such as Bank of America Plaza (1985) and Reunion Tower (1978), create a striking night skyline. The population density is unusually low for a major metropolitan area, reflecting the predominance of single-family homes (about two-thirds of all dwelling units). The city is ethnically diverse, with less than half its population being of European descent. About one-fourth of the residents are African American, and more than one-third are Hispanic. Dallas became well-known in popular culture as the setting for the eponymous television drama series (originally broadcast 1978–91); the ranch where the show was filmed is now a tourist attraction and convention centre.[P6]Buildings in downtown Dallas, Texas.Donovan Reese/Getty Images[ML6] Dallas’s modern economy is well diversified. A top global wholesale market, the city is the home of the Dallas Market Center (1957), one of the world’s largest wholesale merchandise complexes. In addition, it is the world headquarters of the U.S. Army and Air Force Exchange Service, which provides goods and services to military personnel. Wholesale and retail trade combine with services (particularly business, financial, and health) to form the backbone of the economy. Dallas is the leading banking, financial, and trade centre for the Southwest, and some 6,000 companies have their corporate headquarters there. The city is also a busy convention centre and a hub of airline services. It is a well-known medical centre; the headquarters of the American Heart Association is there, as are the Texas A&M College of Dentistry (1905) and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (1943).[P7] Dallas has one of the country’s largest concentrations of telecommunications and high-technology manufacturing and services companies. The top technology fields include software production, computer services, and manufacturing of computer hardware, semiconductors, and wireless communication equipment. Food processing, publishing, printing, and advertising are also important. Clothing manufacture is less significant than in the past, but the city is still known as a regional fashion and women’s apparel centre. Aerospace manufacturing remains an economic factor, although production greatly decreased during the 1990s. Hundreds of oil companies are still headquartered in Dallas, as are many drilling-equipment supply firms and geophysical exploration firms; however, oil and gas extraction now has little economic impact. Cotton’s importance to the city has also declined.[P8] Dallas is a major transportation hub and the trucking and distribution centre of the Southwest. The international airport is one of the world’s busiest, and the amount of cargo passing through it ranks it as the largest inland port in the United States. The city operates a second major airport, Love Field, and a smaller facility for corporate aircraft and general aviation. The region has an extensive network of highways and commuter-rail and light-rail transit systems.[P9] The Dallas–Fort Worth region is one of the state’s principal centres of higher education. In addition to the schools mentioned above, institutions in the Dallas area include Dallas Baptist University (1898), Southern Methodist University (1911), the University of Dallas (1956), the University of Texas at Dallas (1961), and several community colleges.[P10] The city is known for its cultural activities, including opera, ballet, musicals, and symphony concerts; a notable facility is the Kalita Humphreys Theater (1959; part of the Dallas Theater Center), designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Dallas’s arts district is the frequent site of shows and festivals and includes the Dallas Museum of Art, sculpture gardens, galleries of Asian art, and the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center (1989), designed by I.M. Pei. Pioneer Plaza at the Dallas Convention Center features a life-size bronze sculpture of a cattle drive, complete with 70 head of cattle and 3 cowboys. Old City Park preserves some three dozen restored North Texas buildings, most from the 19th century. The John F. Kennedy Memorial Plaza is near the spot where that president was assassinated; the Sixth Floor Museum (in the building facing the plaza from which the assassin allegedly shot) is dedicated to the assassination and its aftereffects.[P11] Fair Park contains extensive recreational facilities, including the Cotton Bowl (home of the annual American collegiate gridiron football classic), a music hall, several museums (including African American art, natural history, and science), a planetarium, an aquarium, a horticulture centre, and the fairgrounds of one of the country’s largest annual state expositions. The Dallas Zoo is noted for its reptile collection. Cowboys Stadium in Arlington is the home of the Dallas Cowboys (American football) and the team’s famous cheerleaders; other professional sports teams include the Texas Rangers (baseball), Dallas Mavericks (basketball), Dallas Stars (ice hockey), and FC Dallas (football [soccer]). Several lakes in and around the city provide outdoor recreational opportunities; White Rock Lake, a reservoir in the northeastern part of the city, is surrounded by parkland that includes an arboretum.[P12] [END-OF-CONTENT]

The original Spanish mission of San Felipe del Rio (c. 1675) on the site was destroyed by Indians, but the name survived until 1883, when it was shortened to avoid confusion with San Felipe de Austin. The present community was founded in 1872. Remnants of an old canal system that carried water from the prolific San Felipe Springs still survive. A port of entry with a busy tourist trade, Del Rio is also a marketing centre for an extensive ranching area, and in recent years it has become a retirement centre. Laughlin Air Force Base lies immediately to the east. The international Amistad Dam with its 84,000-acre (34,000-hectare) lake and recreation area is 12 miles (19 km) upstream.

It evolved as a garrison town laid out as El Paso de Aguila (Spanish: “Eagle Pass”), so named for the area’s abundant birds of prey, near Camp California (on the Gold Rush Trail) and Fort Duncan (1849, now restored in a city park). During the Civil War it was an outlet for Confederate goods that were blockaded elsewhere. The city had special importance during the Mexican Revolution, and as Camp Eagle Pass it was under military authority until 1916. An army airfield, decommissioned after World War II, brought many servicemen into the area. A port of entry, its economy depends on border trade, tourist traffic, farm and ranch business, and industries (notably oil and gas production). Inc. 1908. Pop.

With McAllen and other nearby communities, it forms a metropolitan complex. Old Edinburgh, which no longer exists, was founded by John Young of Scotland near the site of Hidalgo (the original county seat). In 1908, by referendum, the seat was moved to nearby Chapin (established in 1907), which in 1911 was renamed Edinburg (the h was dropped). The city developed as a cotton-ginning centre and a packing and shipping point for the valley’s citrus fruits and vegetables. Oil and natural gas fields are in the vicinity. The city operates one of the nation’s most-scattered school districts, embracing about 945 square miles (2,450 square km) of groves, farmland, and ranchland.

Texas"El Paso"City"El Paso county"extreme western Texas"El Paso, city, seat (1850) of El Paso county, extreme western Texas, U.S. It is located on the Rio Grande, there bridged to Juárez, Mexico, just south of the New Mexico line. The largest of the U.S.-Mexican border cities, it lies at the foot of the Franklin Mountains (at an elevation of 3,762 feet [1,147 metres]) below a narrow pass where the Rio Grande issues from the bare southernmost spurs of the Rocky Mountains.[P1]El PasoEl Paso, Texas.L.C. Rogers[ML1]The strategic site was recognized in 1598 by Juan de Oñate, colonizer of New Mexico, who called it El Paso del Norte (Spanish: “The Pass of the North”). Franciscans established the Mission Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe there in 1659; the original church stands in the central square of Juárez. Spanish survivors of the Pueblo Revolt (1680–92) took refuge there and built other missions nearby, including one at Ysleta, site of the oldest town in Texas (now in El Paso). In 1776 the settlement comprised a string of hamlets and farms inhabited by 5,000 people. Not until after 1827 did a village exist on the river’s north bank at the present site of El Paso. It became U.S. territory in 1848, when an army post was built (commemorated by the Fort Bliss Replica Museum).[P2]The town, laid out in 1859, was on the Butterfield Stage Route to California. It grew slowly until 1881, when four railways arrived; by 1890 its population had increased more than 10-fold to 10,338. Meanders of the Rio Grande to the south resulted in border disputes in the 1860s; Mexican claims to El Chamizal, a wedge of land on the Texas side, were first filed in 1895. The dispute, which involved the relocation of the river’s channel, was finally resolved in 1963 and is commemorated in the 55-acre (22-hectare) Chamizal National Memorial (1968).[P3]Spanish language and culture distinguish the city. Its old adobe buildings are unmistakably Mexican, yet in general appearance El Paso is a modern American metropolis. It is the commercial and financial centre for an extensive trade territory where livestock ranching, irrigated cotton farming, and mineral production are major economic activities. El Paso has a highly diversified industrial structure centring on primary metals, petroleum and gas operations, food products, and apparel. Its copper-lead custom smelter and electrolytic copper refinery processes a significant portion of the nation’s copper. Fort Bliss (home of the U.S. Army Air Defense Center), the William Beaumont General Hospital, and nearby White Sands Missile Range (in New Mexico) augment El Paso’s economy.[P4]A port of entry and an important foreign-trade and transcontinental crossroad on several major highways, it is served by both U.S. and Mexican railroads. It is a tourist gateway to Juárez and the interior of Mexico and to scenic areas of the United States. Downtown El Paso, with its winding streets and restored adobe buildings that house restaurants and shops, is popular with visitors. The city’s attractions include the El Paso Museum of Art and the El Paso Museum of History (1974; originally the El Paso Cavalry Museum). The University of Texas at El Paso originated as the Texas State School of Mines and Metallurgy in 1913. Several of its original buildings were modeled on the Potala Palace of Lhasa, Tibet.

Dallas lies 30 miles (48 km) east; other cities of the metropolitan region include Arlington, Carrollton, Denton, Garland, Grand Prairie, Irving, Lewisville, Mesquite, North Richland Hills, Plano, and Richardson. Alongside its modern industries and contemporary skyscrapers, Fort Worth retains much of the flavour of its Old West heritage.[P1]Skyline of Fort Worth, Texas, reflected in the Trinity River.Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty Images[ML1]Founded in 1849 by Major Ripley Allen Arnold as a military outpost against Comanche raids, it was named for Major General William Jenkins Worth, commander of U.S. troops in Texas at the time. After the army left in 1853, settlers around the fort moved into its buildings. The community began to expand in 1856 when, by popular vote, it displaced neighbouring Birdville (now a part of suburban Haltom City) as the county seat. The actual transfer of county offices to Fort Worth took place in 1860.[P2]A stopover point for longhorn cattle drives on the Chisholm Trail in the early 1870s, Fort Worth became a cattle-shipping boomtown (often called Cowtown) after the arrival in 1876 of the Texas and Pacific Railway. Fort Worth subsequently became the meat-packing centre of the American Southwest. Oil finds caused the development of the petroleum-refining industry in the 1920s, and during World War II aircraft manufacturing began there.[P3]The city’s economy, integrated with that of Dallas, is broadly based. Its diversified industries include the manufacture of aircraft and aerospace equipment, electronics, vision care products, and automobiles. While still a cattle industry headquarters, Fort Worth relies on food-processing, telemarketing, business services, finance, and software production. The city is a transportation hub and the location of headquarters of major rail and airline corporations. Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport (1974) is one of the world’s busiest. Alliance Airport (1988) was constructed specifically for industrial use. The former Carswell Air Force Base was re-established in 1994 as Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth.[P4]Fort Worth’s institutions of higher learning include Texas Christian University (1873), Texas Wesleyan University (1890), Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (1908), and Tarrant County College (1967); the University of Texas at Arlington (1895) is just to the east. The Health Science Center of the University of North Texas is also in the city.[P5]Fort Worth’s Will Rogers Memorial Center comprises a coliseum and an auditorium. Nearby are the Amon Carter Museum (1961), designed by American architect Philip Johnson and housing a fine collection of paintings—notably paintings of the American West by artists such as Frederic Remington and Charles W. Russell; the Kimbell Art Museum, designed by Louis I. Kahn; the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth (founded 1892 as the Fort Worth Public Library and Art Gallery), the state’s oldest art museum, now housed in a building designed by the Japanese architect Tadao Ando; and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History. The Fort Worth Convention Center (1968), spanning 14 downtown city blocks, is a major landmark. The former stockyards are now a national historic district featuring rodeos, western-themed festivals, shops, and restaurants. The Southwestern Exposition Livestock Show and Rodeo is held annually in January. The Texas Motor Speedway (1997), to the north of the city, is one of the nation’s largest sports facilities.

The French explorer La Salle visited the island in 1686 and named it St. Louis for his sovereign, but it remained unoccupied except by Karankawa Indians. In 1777 troops of Bernardo de Gálvez, Spanish governor of Louisiana (later viceroy of Mexico), temporarily occupied the island and named it Gálvez (whence Galveston). The pirate Jean Laffite made the place his headquarters from 1817 to 1821.[P2]Settlement of the island then began, and in 1834 Michel B. Menard organized the Galveston City Company and laid out a town site. During the Texas revolt against Mexico (1835–36), the four ships that constituted the Texas Navy (Invincible, Brutus, Liberty, and Independence) were based at Galveston; the city briefly, before the successful outcome of the Battle of San Jacinto (April 21, 1836), served as the capital of the republic when the temporary president, David Burnet, arrived there with his cabinet. During the Civil War Galveston was an important Confederate supply port; it was captured by a Union fleet in October 1862 but was retaken by Confederates a few months later.[P3]Two factors dislodged Galveston from its leading commercial position: the rise of competitive Texas ports, notably Houston, and a destructive hurricane on September 8, 1900, in which more than 5,000 lives were lost and much of the city was destroyed. After this disaster, a protective seawall 17 feet (5 metres) high and 10 miles (16 km) long was built, paralleled by a wide boulevard overlooked by hotels. The wall broke the force of a powerful hurricane in September 1961 and reduced flood damage. The seawall held back the worst of the storm surge when Hurricane Ike made landfall on September 13, 2008, but it failed to prevent large-scale flooding and widespread damage to homes and businesses.[P4]Shipping, oil refining, food processing, and resort business are major economic assets. Chief exports are cotton, grain, and sulfur; imports include sugar, tea, and bananas. Galveston offers ship repairing, including nuclear-service facilities. The island is connected to the mainland by causeways, and a superhighway gives rapid access to Texas City, Houston, and other communities. Access from the northeast is by ferry from Bolivar Peninsula across Galveston Harbor. The city is the site of the University of Texas Medical Branch (1881); a marine sciences and maritime resources branch of Texas A&M University (1962); and Galveston (junior) College (1966). Of historical and touristic interest is the Strand, a 40-block area of Victorian homes, art galleries, shops, and restaurants. Moody Gardens, adjoining the Galveston Island Convention Center, comprises a pyramid containing an artificial rainforest, an aquarium, a paddle-wheel steamship, and other attractions. Inc. 1839. Pop.

A Spanish mission, Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo Zúñiga (Spanish: “Our Lady of the Holy Spirit of Zúñiga”), and its protective fort, Presidio La Bahía, were established there in 1749 on the site of an Aranama Indian village. The presidio was occupied briefly in 1812 by a filibustering American expedition, led by Augustus Magee, fighting for Mexico against Spain and again in 1821 by James Long’s invading Mississippians. At the beginning of the Texas Revolution (December 1835), the presidio’s Mexican garrison was overwhelmed by Texans led by George Collinsworth and Ben Milam, and on December 20 a preliminary “declaration of independence” was published there. A few weeks after the fall of the Alamo, a detachment of some 330 American and Texan troops at Goliad under Col. James Fannin surrendered (March 20, 1836, after the Battle of Coleto Creek) to superior Mexican forces under Gen. José Urrea. Although Mexican law stipulated that foreign belligerents taken on Mexican soil be executed for piracy, Fannin surrendered with the understanding that his men would be treated as prisoners of war. Mexican Pres. Antonio López de Santa Anna, who was commanding the Mexican forces in Texas, overruled the agreement, and about 400 troops under Fannin’s command (including some who had been captured in other encounters) were shot on March 27, Palm Sunday. Although not as famous as the Battle of the Alamo, the execution of Fannin’s troops at Goliad crystallized public opinion in the United States and contributed to a war frenzy against Mexico. A monument marks the burial site outside the walls of the well-preserved presidio, the officers quarters of which now serve as a museum. The nearby Mission Espíritu Santo has been restored within Goliad State Historic Park.[P1]Goliad: Presidio La BahíaOur Lady of Loreto Chapel in Presidio La Bahía, Goliad, Texas.© Travis Witt[ML1]The name Goliad, in use since 1829, is said to be an anagram of (H)idalgo, for Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, the Mexican priest who led a revolt against Spanish rule in 1810, but some suggest that the name may be derived from the biblical Goliath. The city is now a farming centre (cotton, grains, turkeys, and ranching) with oil and gas interests, but it is known chiefly as a monument to the Texas Revolution.

Texas"Houston"City"and Montgomery counties"southeastern Texas"Houston, inland port city, in Harris, Fort Bend, and Montgomery counties, that is the seat (1836) of Harris county, southeastern Texas, U.S. It is linked by the Houston Ship Channel to the Gulf of Mexico and the Intracoastal Waterway at Galveston, 50 miles (80 km) southeast. Houston is the state’s most populous city and the fourth largest city in the United States. Its skyscrapers rise from the unrelievedly flat Gulf Coastal Plain, which at Houston lies at an elevation of about 55 feet (17 metres) above sea level and is dissected by a series of bayous. The region’s climate is warm and humid, and the city is noted for its hot, sticky summers. In addition to Galveston, other major cities in the Houston metropolitan area include Baytown, League City, Missouri City, Pasadena, Sugar Land, and Texas City. Inc. 1837. Area 601 square miles (1,559 square km). Pop.

A week later, outside the present city at the Battle of San Jacinto, Santa Anna was captured, and Texas was freed. In August 1836 two New York land speculators, the brothers Augustus C. and John K. Allen, bought a site near burned-out Harrisburg and began advertising the place as the future “great interior commercial emporium of Texas.” Two months later John Allen persuaded the first Congress of the Republic of Texas, in session at Columbia, to move to his town, named for the first elected president of Texas, Sam Houston. The maneuver was later denounced, and the government stayed there only two years (1837–39).[P2]Battle of San JacintoPainting that depicts the surrender of Mexican General Santa Anna to Texan Sam Houston after the Battle of San Jacinto. © Niday Picture Library / Alamy[ML2] Mud-bogged and beset by yellow fever epidemics, the town grew slowly as a cotton-shipping port; the first railroad arrived in 1853. During the American Civil War it became a haven for Southerners running the Union naval blockade. Briefly threatened in 1862 when Union forces captured Galveston Island (which was soon recaptured by the Confederates), Houston in 1863 became the headquarters for the Confederacy’s Trans-Mississippi Department (Texas and what was then New Mexico Territory). Segregation became a problem after the war, with separate neighbourhoods developing for whites, Hispanics, and African Americans. Racial tensions resulted in serious rioting in 1917, when black U.S. Army soldiers were stationed in the city; nearly 20 people were killed.[P3]Houston, TexasEngraving of Houston, Texas, in 1845, from the Illustrated London News.Library of Congress, Washington D.C. (reproduction no. LC-USZ61-294)[ML3] Houston developed as a rail centre, with 12 railways by 1891. After a devastating hurricane and flood in 1900 destroyed Galveston’s port facilities, Houston emerged as the state’s leading port. The first dock had been built in 1840, and widening and deepening of Buffalo Bayou (now part of the Houston Ship Channel) had begun in 1869. By the early 1980s the port, then the third largest in the United States in tonnage moved, was handling more than 80 million tons of foreign, coastal, and canal shipping annually. Oil, discovered in the area in 1901, brought considerable industrial development, triggering the city’s expansion and prosperity from its 19th-century economic base of cotton and lumber. The completion of the Houston Ship Channel in 1914 led to the establishment of refineries along it in the 1920s and ’30s.[P4]Map of Galveston Bay, Houston, and vicinity (c. 1900), from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML4] World War II brought shipbuilding and petrochemical industries to Houston, and chemicals remained important after the war ended. Land annexed in 1948 nearly tripled the city’s area. In 1961 the Manned Spacecraft Center (renamed the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1973), the command post for flights by U.S. astronauts, was opened near Clear Lake, about 25 miles (40 km) southeast of downtown, making Houston a focus of the nation’s space program. Houston experienced an economic boom in the 1970s and became a world leader in the energy business; hundreds of companies located their headquarters there. Energy largely supported the city’s economy until the oil industry went bust in the mid-1980s. By the early 1990s the city had recovered, although it sustained another blow when Enron Corp. (headquartered there) collapsed in 2001. The city hosted the Republican National Convention in 1992, and the downtown area underwent a resurgence in the late 1990s as new entertainment venues opened.[P5] Houston’s rapid expansion after World War II was accompanied by increases in air and water pollution and urban sprawl. In addition, flooding has been a recurring problem, although measures to control it were made after serious floods in 1929 and 1935. In 2001 Tropical Storm Allison killed 22 people in the area, damaged office buildings and thousands of homes, and caused widespread flooding in the city. Hurricane Ike, though responsible for far fewer deaths, caused similar damage to Houston shortly after making landfall in nearby Galveston in September 2008. Hurricane Harvey, the strongest storm to make landfall in the United States in more than a decade, drenched the Houston area in August 2017. The city received more than 16 inches (over 400 mm) of rain in a 24-hour period, and catastrophic flooding claimed several lives.[P6] In politics, Houston made news in December 2009 when city controller Annise Parker was elected mayor. Parker, who campaigned on a platform of fiscal responsibility, was the first openly gay individual to be elected mayor of a large U.S. city.[P7]Parker, AnniseAnnise Parker, 2010.Zblume[ML7] [H3]The contemporary city Houston today is a reflection of its tremendous postwar growth. Older buildings downtown are dwarfed by the many modern office towers—such as Pennzoil Place (1976), Chase Tower (1981), and Williams Tower (1983)—that now define the city skyline. Downtown buildings are connected by a system of air-conditioned, underground walkways that allow pedestrians to avoid the high heat and humidity of summer. The city is culturally diverse; fewer than half of its residents are of European descent, more than one-third are Hispanic, about one-fourth are African American, and a smaller but significant fraction is of Asian descent.[P8]Sam Houston Park in Houston, Texas.© MedioImages/Getty ImagesNight view of the skyline of Houston, Texas.Donovan Reese/Getty Images[ML8] Houston remains a leading oil and petrochemical centre. Oil and gas exploration, refining, petrochemical production, and the manufacture of machinery for these industries are major factors, and the city is a focal point for networks of petroleum and natural gas pipelines. In addition, the economy has become more diversified. High-technology industries, trade, and business and financial services have become important. Medical research and health care have a considerable economic impact; the combined institutions of the Texas Medical Center constitute by far the largest single employer in the city. Engineering services, software production, aerospace research and development operations, and aerospace, electronics, and computer manufacturing are also economic strengths. The immense resources of petroleum, natural gas, sulfur, lime, salt, and water in the region have created one of the world’s greatest concentrations of industries along the Houston Ship Channel. The area around the city is also important for rice, cotton, and cattle.[P9]Houston Ship ChannelHouston Ship Channel, Houston, Texas.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers[ML9] Houston is one of the country’s major transportation hubs, with extensive trucking, rail, and air connections. Two major airports, George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P. Hobby Airport, serve the region; a third facility, Ellington Field, is used jointly by commercial, corporate, and military aircraft. The Port of Houston is now the second largest in the United States in tonnage moved; a major international port, its top cargoes (in terms of tonnage) include petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, grain, fertilizer, plastics, iron, and steel. A light-rail commuter line running 7.5 miles (12 km) from Reliant Park to downtown opened in 2004.[P10] Among the many colleges and universities in the area are Rice University (1891), the University of Houston (1927), Texas Southern University (1947), the University of St. Thomas (1947), Houston Baptist University (1960), and several campuses of Houston Community College (1971). The Texas Medical Center (organized 1945) is an immense complex of hospitals, medical schools—including the Baylor College of Medicine (1900) and the University of Texas Health Science Center (1972)—and research institutions.[P11]Rice UniversityLovett Hall, Rice University, Houston, Texas.AniRaptor2001[ML11] Houston is one of the few American cities with a professional symphony orchestra and resident professional companies in ballet, opera, and theatre. The downtown theatre district is home to the major performing arts organizations. The Houston Symphony (founded 1913) is based at Jesse H. Jones Hall for the Performing Arts, the Houston Ballet and Houston Grand Opera (both founded 1955) perform at the Wortham Theater Center, and the Alley Theatre houses the city’s resident theatre group. Southwest of downtown, near the University of St. Thomas, is an area of art museums and galleries anchored on the Menil Collection. Just south of that complex is Hermann Park, the site of the Zoological Gardens and the Museum of Natural Science (which includes a planetarium), and an adjacent museum district has institutions devoted to medical science, the Holocaust, fine arts, and contemporary art.[P12] Farther southwest is Reliant Center (formerly the Astrodomain Complex), which has convention, sports, and entertainment facilities. Reliant Stadium (opened 2002) houses the city’s professional gridiron football team (the Texans) and events such as the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo (February), the world’s largest. The nearby Astrodome (1965), the world’s first full-sized domed and air-conditioned sports stadium, was home to the city’s professional baseball team (the Astros) until 1999, when a new facility, Minute Maid Park, was constructed downtown. Just southwest of the ballpark is the Toyota Center (opened 2003), a multipurpose arena that is the home of the city’s professional basketball team, the Rockets. To the east of the city, the site of the Battle of San Jacinto is preserved as a state historic site. Space Center Houston at the Johnson Space Center is a popular attraction offering educational programs and exhibits. A number of lakes, wildlife refuges, and Galveston Island beaches, as well as an arboretum in the city and Sam Houston National Forest to the north, provide outdoor recreational opportunities.[P13]Buildings in downtown Houston, Texas.© MedioImages/Getty Images[ML13] [END-OF-CONTENT]

Farming and stock raising are economically significant, but lumbering, based on vast tracts of pine trees that cover much of the county, has become a major activity. General Sam Houston, first president of the Republic of Texas, took up residence at Raven Hill in 1847; his last two homes (including Steamboat House, where he died in 1863), his personal effects, and historic relics have been preserved in a memorial park on the campus of Sam Houston State University (1879). A portrait statue 77 feet (23.5 metres) high was erected in 1994. His tomb is in Oakwood Cemetery.

The city is part of the Longview-Kilgore-Gladewater-Tyler oil complex in the middle of the East Texas oil field. In 1871 Judge C.B. Kilgore settled the site, which was then the terminus of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Lumber and cotton became the chief sources of income, but, after the discovery of the vast East Texas pool in 1930, Kilgore became an oil-producing and supply centre with more than 1,200 derricks within the city limits; some 50 derricks remain, mostly as a reminder of the city’s past. While a petroleum-based economy still prevails, some manufacturing (notably of plumbing fixtures and clothing) has also developed. Kilgore (junior) College (1935) is nationally known for its Rangerette precision drill and dance team, and the Rangerette Showcase Museum on campus relates the team’s history.

The city is one of the principal border crossings from Mexico into Texas.[P1]Laredo: Republic of the Rio Grande MuseumRepublic of the Rio Grande Museum, Laredo, Texas.AMAPO[ML1]For more than 200 years Laredo was the scene of violence that included Indian wars, border banditry, and the rowdyism of adventurers on their way to the California goldfields. After the Texas revolt against Mexico (1836), Laredo was in a no-man’s-land and became the seat of the short-lived (1839–41) Republic of the Rio Grande; the building that served as the capitol, over which seven flags have flown, is now the Republic of the Rio Grande Museum.[P2]With its adobe houses, church buildings, mission bells, and plazas, Laredo has retained much of the feeling of the frontier, and the influence and language of Spain and Mexico are apparent. The city has a diversified economic base, which includes tourism and a considerable export-import trade. It is the commercial centre for an area of irrigated farms and ranches and of gas and oil industries and has a range of manufactures, including bricks, clothing, and electronic components. Nuevo Laredo is also a regionally important manufacturing centre; dozens of maquiladoras (border-area factories) were established there after the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994. Laredo subsequently became one of the fastest growing cities in the United States.

It is situated in a region of blackland prairie and was first settled (1845–46) by a group called Peters’ Colony (named for William S. Peters, who had led investors in gaining land grants from the Republic of Texas in the early 1840s). The community was granted a post office in 1851; several names were proposed, and ultimately Plano—which a leading citizen understood to be the Spanish word meaning “plain,” an apt description of the terrain—was selected. The railroad reached Plano in 1872, and, although the town was almost destroyed by fire in 1881, it continued to develop as a small agricultural centre in the midst of a cotton-producing and cattle-raising area. Plano’s rapid population growth began in the 1960s, when the population was less than 4,000, a result of the expansion of the Dallas–Fort Worth area. Plano is a financial and commercial centre, and its manufactures include compact discs, printed materials, metals, satellite communication equipment, and bakery equipment.

The site was settled by Spaniards in 1815. Some refugees from a Comanche raid (1840) on nearby Linnville sought sanctuary there and helped develop the settlement. By 1841 it was known as Port Lavaca. (La vaca, meaning “cow” in Spanish, is thought to refer to the bison that once lived in the area.) Because of hurricanes and Gulf storms, a seawall was built in 1920 to protect the city. For many years Port Lavaca was primarily a processing and marketing centre for seafood. Beginning in the 1960s aluminum and chemical plants were built across the bay at Point Comfort (with which it is linked by causeway); the completion of a deepwater ship channel through Matagorda Peninsula and Bay permits oceangoing vessels from the Gulf of Mexico to enter the harbour of Port Lavaca–Point Comfort.

San Antonio was founded May 1, 1718, when a Spanish expedition from Mexico established the Mission San Antonio de Valero. The mission, later called the Alamo (Spanish: “Cottonwood”), was one of five founded in the area and was named for St. Anthony of Padua. On May 5 a presidio (military garrison) known as San Antonio de Béxar was established nearby. The site, on the river’s west bank, was a stopping place on the trail through the Texas wilderness between missions on the Rio Grande and those in East Texas.[P2] In 1731 settlers from the Canary Islands laid out the town of San Fernando de Béxar near the presidio, where a civilian community had been planned when the presidio and mission were established. During its early years the settlement suffered from raids by Apache and Comanche tribes. The mission was secularized in 1793 and became a military post. San Fernando de Béxar functioned as provincial capital from 1773 to 1824, but in subsequent years its political authority waned. By 1837, when it became a county seat of the Republic of Texas, it had been renamed San Antonio.[P3]San Antonio: mapMap of San Antonio, Texas, 1730.Courtesy of Texas State Library & Archives Commission[ML3] At the time of Mexican independence in 1821, San Antonio was, along with Goliad and Nacogdoches, one of three established Spanish communities in Texas. In the summer of that year, Stephen Austin arrived in the city—then seat of the Spanish government in Texas—to follow through on a permit obtained by his father for the admission of 300 U.S. families into the territory. In December 1835, at the outset of the Texas Revolution, Texan forces occupied the Alamo. They remained there until March 1836, when they were massacred by Mexican troops under General Antonio López de Santa Anna following a 13-day siege. The presidio ceased to exist with the independence of Texas in April.[P4]siege of the AlamoAn overview of the siege of the Alamo.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML4] In 1836 San Antonio was still the foremost city of Texas, with some 2,500 inhabitants. It grew rapidly after independence, led by large numbers of German immigrants. During the last decades of the 19th century, San Antonio, as the starting point for the Chisholm Trail, became a major cattle centre, where herds were assembled for the overland drives to the railheads in Kansas.[P5] The city quickly became the commercial hub of the Southwest. The arrival of the first railroad in 1877 brought migrants from the American South, and Mexican immigrants settled there after the start of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. San Antonio was a major military centre during World Wars I and II, a factor that continued to dominate its economy in subsequent decades. In 1968 a world’s exposition, known as HemisFair, was held there to commemorate the city’s 250th anniversary and to celebrate its cultural ties with Latin America. In 1981 Henry Cisneros was elected the city’s first Hispanic mayor since the mid-19th century; Cisneros served until 1989. In 2001 Ed Garza was elected the city’s second modern-era Hispanic mayor and was in office until 2005.[P6] [H3]The contemporary city San Antonio’s character is a colourful blend of Mexican and Texan culture. It is 150 miles (240 km) from the Mexican border at Laredo, on one of the most-traveled routes to Mexico. Much of its population (about three-fifths) is of Hispanic (mainly Mexican) descent, and many are Spanish-speaking or bilingual. It preserves much of its historical atmosphere and embraces its cultural diversity. Remains of 18th-century Spanish structures dot the city, contrasting with modern office buildings.[P7]The River Walk at night, San Antonio, Texas.Jeremy Woodhouse/Getty Images[ML7] Military installations largely account for San Antonio’s rapid growth after 1940. Fort Sam Houston (1879), inside the city, is the headquarters of the U.S. Fifth Army and is the site of a national cemetery and the Academy of Health Sciences, the army’s basic school for medical personnel. Nearby are three U.S. Air Force bases: Lackland, Randolph, and Brooks. Lackland, in the southwestern part of the city, is a training base for recruits. Randolph, in a suburban area to the northeast, is headquarters of the Air Education and Training Command. Brooks, in the southeastern part of the city, is the site of the School of Aerospace Medicine. The region’s first air base, Kelly (established 1917), was closed in 2001, and its site was redeveloped for business use.[P8] In addition to the military, major components of San Antonio’s economy are education, health care and medical research, business and financial services, and—most importantly—tourism. Manufactures include aerospace equipment, textiles, semiconductors, industrial machinery, and shoes; there are also oil refineries. Agricultural production in the area includes cattle, poultry, peanuts (groundnuts), sorghum, vegetables, and greenhouse plants; the processing of and research on agricultural products is also important. A large portion of trade between Mexico and the United States passes through the San Antonio area’s interstate highway system. The city also has an international airport.[P9] San Antonio is the seat of St. Mary’s University (1852), Trinity University (1869), the University of the Incarnate Word (1881), Our Lady of the Lake University (1896), St. Philip’s College (1898), San Antonio College (1925), and the University of Texas at San Antonio (1969).

Texas"San Felipe"Town"Austin county"southeastern Texas"San Felipe, historic town, Austin county, southeastern Texas, U.S. It lies along the Brazos River, some 45 miles (70 km) west of Houston. Known as the “birthplace of Anglo-American settlement in Texas,” it was founded in 1824 as headquarters for the colony of Stephen Austin, who there first employed the Texas Rangers as a defense force. In 1829 the colony, then known as San Felipe de Austin, published the Gazette, the first English-language newspaper in Texas, and opened one of the first English-language schools in Texas. Conventions petitioning for independence from Mexico were held in the Town Hall (now demolished) in 1832 and 1833, and at the Consultation of 1835 several Anglo-American municipalities met to plan a provisional government and organize the Texas Revolution. In March 1836 San Felipe was burned by retreating Texans under Captain Mosely Baker, prior to occupation by General Antonio López de Santa Anna’s invading Mexican army. The town was rebuilt after the Texan victory at San Jacinto (April 1836), but it declined after Bellville, 15 miles (24 km) to the north, became officially established as the county seat in 1848. Stephen F. Austin State Park, near an old ferry crossing on the river, includes a replica of Austin’s log home and a well dug by the colonists. San Felipe remains a small farming community with narrow roads that bear the names given by the colonists in the 1820s. Pop. (2000) 868; (2010) 747.[P1]San Felipe State Historic SiteThe Stephen F.

Franciscan missionaries probably first saw the river on St. Mark’s Day in 1709. The original Spanish settlement, Villa de San Marcos de Neve, established in 1809 at the Camino Real river crossing, was abandoned in 1812. Resettled by Anglo-Americans in 1846 and laid out in 1851, it developed as an agricultural and ranching centre. It was chartered as a city in 1877, and its growth was boosted by the founding there of Southwest Texas State University (1899). The city’s small farm-based industries and light manufacturing are augmented by tourism. Belvin Street Historic District preserves several of the city’s Victorian buildings.

Founded in the 1840s, it was named for General Sidney Sherman, a cavalry officer during the Texas Revolution and an early railroad promoter. Lying along the Butterfield Trail, it became a rendezvous for cattle drovers, buffalo hunters, and farmers. The railroads arrived in the 1870s. In 1876 Austin College (Presbyterian, founded 1849) was moved to the city from Huntsville.[P1]Agricultural industries (cotton ginning, cottonseed-oil milling, gin-machinery manufacture, and flour milling) developed in Sherman, and local oil and gas deposits were tapped in the 1930s. Since World War II there has been considerable industrial development, including the manufacture of electronic and office equipment, truck bodies, surgical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and aluminum, steel, and wire products.

A trading post called Blue Goose (1877) on nearby Sweetwater Creek was moved to the present site when the Texas and Pacific Railway arrived (1881). Sweetwater was incorporated in 1884, but its growth was handicapped by a severe blizzard (1885), which devastated livestock, and by a great drought (1886–87); the resulting desolation formed the background for Dorothy Scarborough’s novel The Wind (1925). The city’s recovery as a cattle, cotton, and wool centre was sustained by the arrival of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (1911). Local oil resources were tapped in the 1920s, and deposits of gypsum, sand, and clay have been worked since the 1940s. The city’s manufactures include apparel and electronic products. A campus of Texas State Technical College is located just west of the city on the site of Avenger Field.[P1]The nearby Sweetwater, Trammell, and Oak Creek lakes are maintained for water supply and recreation.

The town was annexed by El Paso in 1955, though residents of Ysleta had voted against the merger.[P1]Regarded as the oldest settlement within the present boundaries of Texas, Ysleta was founded in 1681–82 by Spanish padres and Christian Indians who, because of a Pueblo Indian uprising, had fled from their settlements along the upper Rio Grande in the region of La Ysleta (an alternate spelling for the Spanish isleta [“island”]) in what is now New Mexico. The refugees first sought the protection of the Spanish fort El Paso del Norte (now Juarez, Mexico, across the river) and then moved to the present site to found Ysleta del Sur and build the mission Nuestro Señora del Carmen (1682), the oldest mission in Texas (now largely reconstructed).[P2]The Ysleta section of El Paso is characterized by whitewashed old adobe buildings standing between modern structures. The Tigua (Tiwa) Indians maintain a museum and an arts and crafts centre in Ysleta, where the tribe had a small reservation; many members of this group are direct descendants of the Indians who fled the Pueblo revolt. The tribe was officially recognized by the state of Texas in 1967 and by the U.S. Congress the following year. A small stretch of irrigated land just east of the mission is claimed to be the oldest continuously cultivated plot in the United States; originally plowed in 1681, it was planted with corn (maize) and later grapes and a high grade of Egyptian long-staple cotton.[P3] [END-OF-CONTENT]

Interest in the region was rekindled in the mid-1870s, and a settlement became established there by the early 1880s. Both the original mission and the surrounding area bore several names, including Spanish Valley, Grand Valley, and Poverty Flats, before the 1880s, when the city was named Moab—the general understanding being that it was named for the biblical “land beyond the Jordan,” although another possibility is that the name came from a Paiute word meaning “mosquito water.” Moab emerged in the early 1900s as a centre of stone-fruit cultivation.[P2]In the early 1950s a uranium-mining boom transformed the quiet town into a bustling industrial centre. The uranium boom and subsequent production of locally discovered oil and potash faded in the 1960s, after which Moab successfully transformed itself into a tourist centre for the scenic region surrounding the city. Notable attractions include the adjacent Arches National Park (north), Dead Horse Point State Park and beyond that Canyonlands National Park (southwest), and a unit of Manti-La Sal National Forest (southeast). Moab has also become a popular destination for recreational and competitive mountain bikers eager to experience the Slickrock Bike Trail.

Laid out by Young according to Joseph Smith’s plan for the city of Zion, the city was divided into 10-acre (4-hectare) blocks bounded by wide streets grouped around the Temple Block (now known as Temple Square). Mormon immigrants from the East and Europe flocked to the “New Jerusalem,” the “City of the Saints,” in the Provisional State of Deseret (a Book of Mormon word interpreted as “honeybee”). The California Gold Rush of 1849 contributed to the city’s growth.[P2] After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), Utah passed to U.S. sovereignty and became a territory in 1850. Salt Lake City was the territorial capital from 1856 to 1896, when it became the capital of the new state. Conflicts between Mormons and U.S. officials led to the so-called Utah War of 1857–58, when General Albert Sidney Johnston’s troops marched through the city to establish Camp Floyd west of Utah Lake.

Utah"Vernal"City"Uintah county"northeastern Utah"Vernal, city, seat (1880) of Uintah county, northeastern Utah, U.S. The city lies along Ashley Creek, a small tributary of Green River, and is located 180 miles (290 km) east-southeast of Salt Lake City, at an elevation of 5,322 feet (1,622 metres) in an area of geologic and fossil interest. Settled in 1878 as Ashley Center (for the fur trader William H. Ashley), it was renamed Vernal in 1893, implying a springlike growth (hence, progress).[P1]The Vernal area experienced a boom with the discovery of gold and other minerals and metals in the 1890s, which in turn attracted outlaws such as Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch, who maintained a headquarters nearby. When the mining boom and its associated outlawry drew to an end later in the decade, Vernal developed as a trading and processing centre for a ranching and dairy area. It later became a tourist centre for the High Uintas Primitive Area within Ashley National Forest (which lies to the northwest and is headquartered at Vernal), the Dinosaur National Monument (12 miles [19 km] east), and the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area (40 miles [64 km] north). The hub of Utah’s “Dinosaurland,” it is the site of the Utah Field House of Natural History and hosts a summer art festival; the Dinosaur Roundup Rodeo (July) and a quarter horse show and race (June) are also held there. The Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation and its Hill Creek Extension lie just to the west and south of Vernal. Aside from livestock farming, the locality has mining (gilsonite, oil, oil shale, phosphate rock, and natural gas) and lumbering. The Mormon church dedicated a temple in Vernal in 1997. Inc. 1879.

It includes the villages of Old Bennington, Bennington, and North Bennington. The site, chartered as a town in 1749, was settled in 1761 and named for Benning Wentworth, governor of New Hampshire, who issued the grant. The settlers were led by Samuel Robinson, who camped in the river valley on his return from the French and Indian War. Within the year the group had organized a town-meeting government that has survived to this day with only slight modifications. These pioneers, among them Ethan Allen’s Green Mountain Boys, successfully resisted the claims to Bennington lands by absentee landlords of New York, and the independence of Vermonters was soon established.[P1]Bennington Battle MonumentThe Bennington Battle Monument, Bennington, Vermont.Eixo[ML1]During the 19th century the town grew into a textile, pottery, wood products, and paper centre.

The site was settled in the late 1600s, and a community known as Belhaven was founded there in 1731. English and Scottish merchants then established a tobacco warehouse in Belhaven, and the settlement soon became an important shipping centre. It was organized in 1749 and renamed for John Alexander, who had originally been granted the land, and in 1779 it was incorporated as a town. Alexandria has the unique distinction of being designated an independent city (without county affiliation) by an act of Congress (1852).

Formed as an independent city in 1963 by a merger of the city of South Norfolk (incorporated 1919) and Norfolk county (created 1636), it is one of the largest (341 square miles [883 square km]) cities in area in the country, encompassing sections of farmland and portions of the Great Dismal Swamp.[P1]The area, once the home of the Chesapeake Indians, was settled by colonists in the early 1630s. During the American Revolution, British and American forces clashed in the area in December 1775 in the battle of Great Bridge. Although Union troops occupied and destroyed parts of the Chesapeake area during the American Civil War, it soon recovered. Urban development had begun by the early 1900s.[P2]Crisscrossed by inland waterways, Chesapeake has port facilities and is a major oil-storage centre. Its manufactures include steel products, cement, fertilizer, and lumber. Nursery, greenhouse, and truck-farm produce contribute to the economy.

Chartered in 1793, it became an inspection warehouse and river transport point for tobacco. After completion of the railroad (1848), it became one of the nation’s largest flue-cured, bright-leaf tobacco markets. During the American Civil War, Danville was the site of a Confederate prison camp; more than 1,300 Union prisoners are buried in Danville National Cemetery. For a week following the fall of Richmond (April 3, 1865), Danville was the seat of the Confederacy; the Confederate Memorial Mansion, now the Danville Museum of Fine Arts and History, is known as the Last Capitol of the Confederacy.[P2]Development of the Dan River Cotton Mills (later Dan River, Inc.) in the 1880s made the city a leading textile centre. The mill complex, once the largest single-unit textile factory in the world, finally ceased operation in 2006. The city’s manufactures include tires, furniture, and glass and wood products. Cheap hydroelectric power for the city was gained by harnessing the falls (pinnacles) of the Dan River. The city owns and operates the Pinnacles Hydro-Electric Station, completed in 1938. Danville has two institutions of higher learning: Averett College (1859) and Danville Community College (1968; originally a technical school established in 1936).

Grimes[ML1]Hampton originated around Fort Algernourne (now Fort Monroe), built in 1609 on the site of the village of Kecoughtan, named for the tribe that inhabited it, to protect the area from Spanish raiders. Permanent settlement dates from 1610, which makes it the nation’s oldest continuously settled community of English origin. It became part of Elizabeth City (later reorganized as Elizabeth City county) in 1620. St. John’s Church was established in 1610; the present structure, dating from 1728, has been restored. Hampton, named in the late 1600s for Henry Wriothesley, 3rd earl of Southampton, was organized as a town in 1705. It grew as a seaport, being surpassed later by Norfolk. Attacked by pirates (notably Blackbeard) in the early 1700s, and again during the American Revolution and the War of 1812, it was burned by Confederates in 1861 at the beginning of the American Civil War to prevent its capture by Union forces occupying nearby Old Point Comfort and Fort Monroe. It was rebuilt after the war and later flourished with the arrival of the railroad in the 1880s. Fishing and seafood-processing industries subsequently developed.[P2]Military installations and tourism are important to the economy. Fort Monroe (headquarters for the U.S. Continental Army Command), Langley Air Force Base, and the Langley Research Center for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are in the city. The Syms-Eaton Museum commemorates Benjamin Syms and Thomas Eaton, who founded the first free schools (1634 and 1659, respectively) in America; the two schools merged in 1805 as Hampton Academy, which was later absorbed into the city’s public school system. Hampton University (1868) was established by General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, an agent of the Freedmen’s Bureau, to educate former slaves. Thomas Nelson Community College opened there in 1968.

Settlement began in 1613 around a plantation called Bermuda City, but an attack by Indians destroyed the plantation in 1622. A new settlement was erected and named for the ship that brought Hopewell’s founder, Frances Eppes, to the area in 1635. Hopewell was the birthplace (1773) of statesman John Randolph of Roanoke and Edmund Ruffin, who fired the first shot at Fort Sumter at the start of the American Civil War. Its Appomattox Manor (1635) was shelled by troops led by Benedict Arnold during the American Revolution. City Point, later annexed by Hopewell in 1923, served as the headquarters of Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant (June 1864–April 1865) during the Union siege of nearby Petersburg.[P1]When a munitions plant was established there in 1914, Hopewell’s population skyrocketed.

The land was bought from Nicholas Wise, a carpenter, for 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg) of tobacco. For many years Norfolk was a trade outlet for eastern North Carolina (tar, lumber, hides, and tobacco). Later, shipbuilding and ship repairing became important. A lucrative trade developed with Britain and the West Indies, and, in recognition of its commercial importance, Norfolk was presented a silver mace by Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie in 1753.[P2]During the American Revolution the royal governor, John Murray, 4th earl of Dunmore, made it his headquarters (December 1775), declared martial law, and defeated the Virginia militiamen at nearby Kempsville. Later in the month Colonel William Woodford and his Virginia riflemen routed the British at Great Bridge and occupied Norfolk, which on January 1, 1776, was bombarded by Dunmore’s fleet anchored in the Elizabeth River. The Virginians later burned what was left of the town except for St. Paul’s Church (1738; which still has a cannonball in its south wall) to prevent its use by the British. Norfolk’s recovery was hampered by the stifling of the West Indies trade by Britain, restriction on shipping and privateering by the European powers during the Napoleonic Wars, a disastrous fire in 1799, and intercity rivalry. During the War of 1812 it was twice saved from the British—when a local militia beat off a land attack on Portsmouth and when General Robert B. Taylor’s defense of Craney Island prevented an amphibious invasion by barge.[P3]With subsequent canal and railroad construction, prosperity returned until a yellow-fever epidemic struck in 1855 and killed 10 percent of the population. During the American Civil War Norfolk fell (May 1862) to Union forces under General John E. Wool and was occupied for the rest of the war. Its prosperity resumed after 1880 with the converging of railways on the port and was stimulated during World Wars I and II with the installation of a huge naval and naval-air complex. Norfolk, with Portsmouth, is now headquarters of the Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Command (CINCUSACOM) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SANCLANT).

The Elizabeth River flows into Hampton Roads and forms part of a fine natural harbour there. Portsmouth was the seat of Norfolk county from 1803; the county ceased to exist in 1963, when it was divided into independent cities.[P1]Portsmouth: Norfolk Naval ShipyardUSS Theodore Roosevelt at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Va.U.S. Navy[ML1]The land was first granted in 1659 to Captain William Carver, but his execution during Bacon’s Rebellion (1676) delayed the town’s establishment. The area was later granted to Colonel William Crawford, then justice of Norfolk county, who founded it in 1752 and named it for Portsmouth, England. The town was occupied alternately by British and American troops during the American Revolution. A shipyard, built in 1767 by Andrew Sprowle, a wealthy Scottish merchant, was reestablished in 1801 as the Norfolk Navy Yard by the U.S. government. In 1861, at the beginning of the American Civil War, Union troops evacuated the navy yard and burned it. The South fell heir to great stores of equipment there and built the Confederate ironclad Virginia from the hull of the scuttled USS Merrimack. The yard was recaptured by Union troops in 1862. In response to American needs in the war against Spain in 1898, the navy yard converted to using steel and steam for shipbuilding. It subsequently produced the USS Texas, the navy’s first commissioned battleship, and the USS Langley, the navy’s first aircraft carrier.[P2]Portsmouth forms part of the important U.S. military complex at Hampton Roads. Shipbuilding and repairing in the port’s navy yard, officially called the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, are the main economic activities. The city has varied manufactures, including chemicals, fertilizers, plastics, and railroad equipment, and Tidewater Community College (1968) is located there. Naval relics are displayed in the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Museum. The Portsmouth Naval Hospital (1830) is near the site of old Fort Nelson (a former British stronghold).

The community was developed after 1962 by Robert E. Simon, whose initials form the first syllable of its name; it opened in 1965. Reston, an original concept in urban planning, consists of a number of villages (separated by woodland tracts), each with a “town centre” serving as a retail area. The layout is designed to minimize road traffic by locating a variety of dwellings within a half-mile (1-km) radius of each town centre. The overall community aims to be self-sustaining with shopping centres, industries, schools, and recreational, cultural and medical facilities. Dulles International Airport is nearby.

Virginia"Richmond"City"Henrico county"situated in the east-central part of the state at the head of navigation of the James River"Richmond, city, capital of Virginia, U.S., seat (1752) of Henrico county, situated in the east-central part of the state at the head of navigation of the James River. Politically independent of the county, it is the centre of a metropolitan area including the rest of Henrico county and Chesterfield and Hanover counties. The English first explored the site in 1607, when a party led by Christopher Newport and John Smith sailed upriver shortly after the founding of Jamestown. A trading post was established (1637) by Thomas Stegg at the fall of the James, and in 1645 Fort Charles was built there. In 1733 William Byrd of Westover named the settlement for Richmond upon Thames, England, and the town was laid out four years later by surveyor Major William Mayo on a site that became known as Church Hill.[P1]Virginia State Capitol, Richmond.GSGH/Virginia Tourism Corporation[ML1]The Virginia convention of 1774, forming a standing body of anti-British sentiment, met there. During the American Revolution Richmond replaced Williamsburg as the state capital (1779), and the town was pillaged by the British under Benedict Arnold in January 1781. Construction of the present capitol building, designed by Thomas Jefferson, began in 1785. In 1840 the city was linked to Lynchburg by the James River and Kanawha Canal, and by 1860 it was served by several railroads. Following the secession of Virginia (April 1861) at the outbreak of the American Civil War, the capital of the Confederacy was moved (July 1861) from Montgomery, Alabama, to Richmond. It thus became a major Union military target. In 1862 General George B. McClellan’s Army of the Potomac approached the city but was driven away in the Seven Days’ Battles (June 25–July 1). It was not again seriously threatened until the siege of Richmond and Petersburg (June 1864). Finally, on April 3, 1865, General Ulysses S. Grant broke the Confederate defense and took the city; much of the business district was burned during its evacuation. Richmond recovered rapidly during the Reconstruction era, mainly because of its prosperous tobacco industry.[P2]Map of Richmond, Va., c. 1900 from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.Petersburg Campaign: Ruins of RichmondRuins of Richmond, Virginia, as seen from across the James River.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.[ML2]Tobacco remains important economically; printing and publishing and the manufacture of chemicals, textiles, pharmaceuticals, metals, and wood and paper products are also significant.

Settled in 1740, it developed after 1882, when it became a junction of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railroad, offering an outlet for the coal deposits of Virginia and West Virginia. Chartered in 1874 it was known as the town of Big Lick but was renamed Roanoke (1882) for the Indian term for shell money or for a nearby salt marsh. Large railroad shops and offices were built, and the arrival of the Virginia Railroad, in 1906, assured further growth. Fabricated steel and textile industries were established. The expansion of truck lines and the city’s location near the scenic Skyline Drive and Blue Ridge Parkway have sustained the economy.

Settled by John Lewis in 1736 and laid out by his son, Thomas, in 1747, it was named for Lady Rebecca Staunton, wife of Sir William Gooch, a colonial governor of Virginia. From 1738 to 1770 it was the capital of what was then the Northwest Territory. During the American Revolution the Virginia legislature met for a brief period in Staunton’s Trinity Episcopal Church, rebuilt in 1855 as the Old Trinity Church. Staunton became a transportation centre after the arrival of the Virginia Central Railroad in 1854. An important supply base during the American Civil War, the town was twice occupied by Union troops. Staunton was the first U.S. community to adopt the city-manager plan of municipal government (1908).[P1]Staunton is a market and shipping point for fruit, poultry, cattle, grain, and vegetables.

Turner Joy, one of two destroyers involved in the incidents that precipitated the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, deepening U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Lumber and dairy industries also contribute to the city’s economy. Bremerton is home to Olympic College (1946; two-year) and is a gateway to the recreational areas of the Olympic Peninsula.

The community bore that name until 1875, when John Shoudy platted a town site and named it for his wife, Ellen. The building of the Northern Pacific Railway through to Puget Sound in 1886 spurred the community’s growth, and by 1889 Ellensburg was populous enough to have been a leading candidate for the site of the Washington state capital. Central Washington University, founded as a teachers college (Washington State Normal School) in 1890, is still a major source of employment.[P1]Ellensburg cherishes a Wild West tradition and is the site of the state’s major rodeo (Labor Day weekend); the area, which is on the western edge of the high desert, is also known for its dude ranches.

Some neighbourhoods, notably those near the Duwamish Waterway to southwest of the city centre, are industrial in character, marked by rail yards, wharves, cranes, and low-income housing projects. Others, largely outside the city centre, are showcases for the opulence wrought by Seattle’s booming high-technology sector.[P4]SeattleNight view of Seattle.Hisham F. Ibrahim/Getty Images[ML4] Seattle’s districts have a comfortably prosperous but not ostentatious feel, characterized by neat family homes and townhouses occupied by industrial workers, artists, academics, professionals, and that odd class of technology workers whom the novelist Douglas Coupland branded “microserfs.” The city is more closely connected to its downtown area than most of its counterparts in the American West, and considerable effort has been given to promoting the city centre as a place in which to live and work.[P5] Seattle is a bustling place that thrives with industrial, commercial, and cultural activity around the clock. Its waters teem with great oceangoing ships, its streets with automobiles, its rail lines with transcontinental freighters and passenger trains, and its skies with aircraft of every description. Although the city’s image is of a financial and commercial centre, its people place great value on the arts, literature, sports, and other cultural activities; it boasts large arenas, multistory bookshops, dozens of museums and galleries, and countless examples of public art.[P6] The city is densely populated. The metropolitan area, loosely defined, has grown to embrace once far-outlying satellites such as Everett and Renton. The shift from urban to bedroom communities is a consequence of several economic considerations, among them the rapid escalation within the city of the cost of family housing. Many Seattle workers have elected to commute from distant but more affordable towns beyond the city proper. By the early 21st century some 200,000 workers commuted to downtown Seattle from neighbouring communities, creating heavy traffic and disruptions on interstate and regional highways. Despite the high real estate prices, however, the inner city remained popular among certain groups, such as young renters.[P7] Seattle grew rapidly at the end of 20th century, aided in its expansion by the arrival of workers—many of them highly skilled and educated—from around the world but also from recession-prone southern California. Growth, a constant theme in the city’s history, has been so persistent in Seattle and elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest that regional planners now locate the city at the centre of an emerging region called “Cascadia,” a corridor some 400 miles (645 km) long extending from Eugene, Oregon, to Vancouver, British Columbia. Cascadia’s commercial importance continues to grow substantially each year. Other models of urban growth make Seattle part of a conurbation called “Pugetopolis,” which extends southwest along Puget Sound as far as Olympia.[P8] Despite Seattle’s enormous growth, it still maintains a high level of social and public services, excellent schools, and abundant parks and greenbelts, which have earned it the sobriquet “the Emerald City.” It is consistently rated one of North America’s most livable cities, and, despite the vagaries of a highly volatile information-technology economy, its fortunes seem to be ever on the rise.[P9] [H3]City site Seattle lies on the southeastern shore of Puget Sound, a deep 100-mile- (160-km-) long inlet of the northern Pacific Ocean. The central portion of the city faces Elliott Bay, a deep-floored extension. At Shilshole Bay, to the northwest, Puget Sound is joined by the 8-mile- (13-km-) long Lake Washington Ship Canal. The canal passes through Lake Union, Portage Bay, and Union Bay to Lake Washington, a 22-mile (35-km) stretch of fresh water bordered by thriving cities and towns; some of these towns are connected by bridge to Seattle. Bainbridge and Vashon islands, in Puget Sound, contain numerous bedroom communities, and cities across the sound are increasingly being integrated into the Seattle conurbation.[P10]Puget Sound and Seattle, Wash.Buphoff[ML10] Seattle lies in the Puget Lowland, the structure of which is determined by the movement of plates along the Juan de Fuca subduction zone to the west. A tectonic feature, the Seattle Fault, crosses Puget Sound in an east-west direction, traveling through downtown Seattle westward to the Cascade Range. The region is tectonically and volcanically active; significant earthquakes occurred along the Juan de Fuca Plate in 1949, 1965, and 2001. The region’s present landscape is the product less of earthquake action than of three to six episodes of intense glaciation—the last of which occurred about 15,000 years ago—that scoured out Puget Sound and deposited great quantities of sediment that are subject to erosion, landslides, weathering, and other nonglacial processes.[P11]The Lake Washington Ship Canal opening into Lake Washington, Seattle.© Adam Augustyn[ML11] The Seattle waterfront comprises mostly mudflats and coastal lowland carved by the Duwamish River—much of which was dredged and straightened in the early 20th century to create the Duwamish Waterway, an industrial channel—and by smaller streams. Beyond the shores of Puget Sound and Lake Washington, the landscape is an attractive mixture of rolling hills and a few steep ridges, the result of a landscape-altering program that occurred in the early 1900s. Drainage occurs through a network of streams, some channelized and some more or less natural. The ever-growing urbanization of the region has led to an increase in the incidence of intracity flooding as tree-lined meadows and other catchments give way to lawns and parking lots that cannot hold rainwater runoff. Mountains, including 14,410-foot (4,392-metre) Mount Rainier and the distant peaks of the Cascade and Olympic ranges, frame the skyline. The city centre lies approximately 110 miles (180 km) to the south of the U.S.-Canadian border, and Seattle enjoys a long-standing historical and commercial connection with the Canadian province of British Columbia. The city also lies about one-third of the way to the Pacific Ocean from the Snoqualmie Pass of the Cascade Range, which provides an overland route into the interior of the Pacific Northwest.[P12] [H4]Climate Seattle’s climate is temperate, with cool summers and mild winters. To the west, the Olympic Mountains provide protection from the heavy winter rains that frequently inundate the Pacific coast of Washington, while the tall Cascades to the east shield the city from midcontinental extremes of heat and cold. Average high temperatures in July seldom exceed the mid-70s F (about 24 °C), while average highs in January are in the upper 40s F (about 8 °C). The temperature drops below freezing for about 10 to 15 days annually. Owing to the confluence of humid continental and oceanic weather systems, the sky is often overcast. However, the city receives an average of only 37 inches (940 mm) of precipitation each year. The summer sky is usually at least partly clear, but overall there are fewer than 60 completely sunny days annually.[P13] [H5]City layout Since its founding, Seattle has grown from its historic centre of Pioneer Square, the city’s oldest neighbourhood and a federally designated historic district. The area’s redbrick townhouses, once residential, now house art galleries, restaurants, bookshops, and small businesses of many kinds. Pioneer Square is bounded by “Skid Road,” or Yesler Way, where, in the early years of the city, cut logs were rolled on a wooden skid downhill to a steam-powered sawmill on the waterfront. The square also is the site of the 42-story Smith Tower, which upon its completion in 1914 was the tallest building in the American West. To the south of the square lie rail yards, as well as Safeco Field and CenturyLink Field, two sports stadiums built in the late 1990s and early 2000s that are the home fields of, respectively, the Mariners (baseball) and Seahawks (gridiron football).[P14]Safeco Field, Seattle.© Aaron Whitney/Shutterstock.com[ML14] The downtown district is Seattle’s commercial heart. Of particular interest to visitors is the Pike Place Market, a sheltered area of fresh fish and produce shops, other retail stores, and restaurants. To the east and northeast of the downtown district stand First Hill and Capitol Hill, low bluffs covered by office buildings and commercial properties. Capitol Hill has many stately mansions and is a lively centre for shopping and nightlife. Beyond them are the Central District, the traditional hub of the city’s African American population, and the large residential Madrona neighbourhood, which faces Lake Washington.[P15]The Public Market Center sign above the main entrance to the Pike Place Market, Seattle.© Dave McNally[ML15] To the north of Pioneer Square, downtown, and the popular neighbourhood of Belltown stands Seattle Center, the 74-acre (30-hectare) site of the 1962 World’s Fair. The centre contains the 605-foot- (184-metre-) high Space Needle, Seattle’s best-known landmark, as well as McCaw Hall (home of the Seattle Opera), Key Arena, the Children’s Museum, the Museum of Pop Culture, and other public buildings. There the high-rise downtown cityscape gives way to the pleasant urban neighbourhoods of Magnolia, which borders Puget Sound, and Queen Anne, located east-southeast of Magnolia between Lake Union, the Lake Washington Ship Canal, and Elliott Bay. South Lake Union was a relatively sleepy area until Amazon.com consolidated all of its offices there in 2010, which led to rapid growth that was partially enabled by a streetcar line that had opened in the neighbourhood in 2007. Other residential districts lie to the north of the canal, such as Phinney Ridge and Greenwood—a large, loosely defined pair of neighbourhoods that feature small restaurants, coffeehouses, and other independent businesses—and Ballard, the historic locus of the city’s sizable Nordic population. Fremont, which lies to the east of Ballard, was for years home to many of the city’s artists, and it maintains a strong countercultural bent despite recent gentrification (its chamber of commerce playfully bills Fremont as the “Center of the Universe”). Fremont also contains a number of Seattle’s notable public sculptures, including an 18-foot- (5.5-metre-) tall troll underneath the Aurora Bridge and a bronze statue of Vladimir Lenin that originally stood in Poprad, Czechoslovakia (now in Slovakia), until shortly before the peaceful overthrow of that country’s communist regime. The University of Washington campus lies at the eastern end of the canal, near Lake Washington, and is surrounded by a vibrant community filled with shops, bars, and restaurants called the University (or “U”) District.[P16]The Space Needle, Seattle.© Dave McNally[ML16] Among the chief satellite cities are Bellevue, on the eastern shore of Lake Washington, about 10 miles (16 km) east of Seattle, which is principally residential and commercial, with many retail trade centres, office complexes, and light manufacturing facilities; Redmond, about 15 miles (25 km) northeast of Seattle, the headquarters of several high-technology companies, including Microsoft and Nintendo of America, and today among the fastest-growing cities in the region; Everett, at the mouth of the Snohomish River, some 25 miles (40 km) north of Seattle and a major port and manufacturing centre; and Renton, approximately 15 miles southeast of Seattle, which maintains lumber, steel, and clay industries and is the site of a large Boeing Company aircraft plant and a railroad-car foundry.[P17] [H6]People Since Seattle’s settlement by Americans of European birth or descent in the mid-19th century, that population has remained in the majority. In the early 21st century they made up slightly more than two-thirds of the central city’s population, a figure that rose to more than about three-fourths in the neighbouring suburbs of King county. Even so, Seattle is a mix of peoples, cultures, and religions and has a higher level of ethnic diversity than is to be found elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest.[P18] There are few notable ethnic divisions or ongoing controversies today, although, like other major American cities, Seattle reveals a past marred by racial prejudice. This was true early on between settlers from the United States and the area’s Native American population, some of whom were removed from traditional territories to inland reservations in the wake of the Indian wars of the 1850s and ’60s. Native Americans were discouraged from living among the settlers throughout the 19th century. Even today, the Native American population is small, representing just a fraction of the city’s total population.[P19] Similarly, Seattle’s African American population was small until World War II; it grew from about 3,800 in 1940 to more than 30,000 by 1945, the result of an abundance of jobs in the defense and transport industries. In the period immediately after the war, the African American population declined but remained significant at about 16,000. Largely confined in the 19th century to the harbourside area of the city called Skid Road, African Americans faced a pattern of discrimination that was severe even by the discriminatory standards of the American West of the time. For example, they were forbidden to enter skilled-trade unions until the late 1940s, and segregation in housing and public services persisted until well into the 1950s. In the early 21st century, African Americans made up a little under one-tenth of greater Seattle’s population, with about half of them living in the suburbs.[P20] Seattle’s Asian population is slightly larger than the African American population. The Chinese, who had settled in the area in small numbers in the early 1800s, first arrived in appreciable numbers in the 1870s to work in service jobs and in the lumber industry, which paid them substantially less than their European-descended counterparts; in later years they made great contributions to the building of the transcontinental railroad. During an economic downturn in the mid-1880s, these Chinese immigrants were accused of taking jobs away from the majority population and were subsequently driven out of the city through a series of destructive anti-Chinese riots. Most of the immigrants fled to San Francisco, where they faced somewhat less-violent, though still persistent, opposition. Seattle’s Asian population is concentrated in the downtown International District, but it has begun to extend throughout the metropolitan area. The majority are of Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Vietnamese origin or descent, though virtually all Asian nations are represented in Seattle. Hispanics account for a smaller proportion of the population, although their number is growing. Most Spanish-speaking newcomers are of Mexican descent or are recent arrivals from Mexico itself; others are from Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, and other Latin American countries. Many Hispanic immigrants have settled in the South Park neighbourhood west of the Duwamish Waterway.[P21] Among Seattleites of European extraction, the dominant religion is Protestantism; the Roman Catholic population is also large, and, owing to a well-established eastern European immigrant community, the Orthodox church has many adherents. Seattle also has a relatively large Jewish community, whose presence in the city dates to the 1860s. The first Jewish congregation was established in 1889 and built the city’s first synagogue in 1892. A significant proportion of Seattleites, however, profess no religion; although statistics on the question are inexact, statewide religious surveys reveal that anywhere from one-sixth to one-fourth of Washingtonians are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise unaffiliated, and Seattle’s liberal social and political milieu suggests that the city has at least the same proportion of nonreligious citizens.[P22] [H7]Economy Until the 20th century, Seattle’s economy was based on lumbering and the extraction and transport of other locally abundant natural resources. Its economy diversified with the development of manufacturing (including aircraft and heavy machinery), food processing, banking, insurance, and transportation industries in the early 20th century, all of which expanded markedly during and after World War II. Electronics-based industries, notably those connected with software development and manufacturing, became significant in the 1980s and are now the most productive component of the economy. Biomedical manufactures are of growing importance, while agricultural products grown in the so-called Inland Empire of the interior Northwest remain an economic mainstay. Numerous federal agencies have offices in Seattle. Washington state ranks among the highest in the country in per capita exports, and the vast majority of these exports are manufactured, processed, or shipped from Seattle. International trade is the most dynamic sector of the state and city economy, symbolized by the construction of the World Trade Center Seattle complex.[P23] Seattle’s workforce is large and generally well educated. Women comprise almost half of full-time workers. The median family income is well above the national average, reflecting a strong local and regional economy.[P24] Manufacturing Seattle was formerly the headquarters for the Boeing Company, the world’s largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft and among the largest exporters in the country in the second half of the 20th century. Although Boeing relocated to Chicago in 2001, much of the company’s airplane production is still based in Seattle. Founded in 1916 as a military-aircraft manufacturer, Boeing produces commercial jetliners as well as a range of military and space-exploration craft. The largest manufacturer in the Seattle area is the Microsoft Corporation, the world’s largest maker of computer operating systems and applications such as word-processing and spreadsheet programs. Although it has offices throughout the world, Microsoft does most of its research and product development at its corporate headquarters in suburban Redmond. Its presence has attracted many software firms to the Seattle area and spurred much infrastructure development, including the construction of reliable broadband fibre-optic networks.[P25]Microsoft Corporation chairman Bill Gates at a press conference in Seattle, 2001.PRNewsFoto/Waggener Edstrom/AP Images[ML25] Although it declined in economic importance after the end of the Cold War, the U.S. Department of Defense remains a large employer in the Seattle region. Among its facilities are the U.S. Army’s Fort Lewis, the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Naval Base Kitsap, McChord Air Force Base, and Naval Station Everett. Puget Sound’s once-prominent shipbuilding industry, which focused primarily on military craft, has declined, and several shipbuilding yards have been decommissioned or converted to other uses, including the disposal of nuclear weapons.[P26] Other important industries in the Seattle area include biotechnology, bioinformatics, genomics, environmental engineering, lumber and wood-product processing, food processing, and the manufacture of industrial machinery and equipment, medical equipment, and textiles. The city is headquarters to the Weyerhaeuser Corporation and to the U.S. North Pacific fishing fleet.[P27] Finance and other services Seattle serves as the chief financial and commercial centre for the Pacific Northwest. The Seattle-born Starbucks coffee-shop chain and Amazon.com, an Internet-based retailer, are now bywords across the world; Nordstrom’s department store chain, founded in Seattle, stretches nationwide.[P28]An Amazon.com order-fulfillment centre, 2010.Amazon.com, Inc.[ML28] Seattle has always been attractive to tourists. The sector received a boost in the late 1990s with the Port of Seattle’s decision to expand its cruise-ship activity; this led to an enormous increase in the number of passengers passing through the city in the early 21st century at the same time that Seattle tourism in general was growing. The largest proportion of visitors, some four-fifths, come from within the United States; about another one-tenth are from Canada.[P29] Transportation An extensive network of interstate, federal, and state highways and local roads serves Seattle; two interstate highways pass through the city, and pontoon bridges span Lake Washington into the urban centre. In the 1990s the city government embarked on an ambitious program to retrofit bridges to withstand potentially strong earthquakes and to improve safety. Heavily traveled, these roads are subject to traffic gridlock, a pervasive problem that remains unresolved.[P30]Container ship in the port of Seattle, Wash.© Art Wager/iStock.com[ML30] The Port of Seattle, established in 1911, is one of the largest container-cargo ports in the United States and in the world. The port encompasses some 570 acres (230 hectares) of container-handling facilities. Ferries serve nearby Vashon Island, Bainbridge Island, Bremerton, and other points along Puget Sound; some travel as far north as Victoria, British Columbia. Passenger cruise ships operating from Seattle regularly travel the Inside Passage to southern Alaska. Navigation locks along the Lake Washington Ship Canal allow boats to pass between Puget Sound and Lake Washington.[P31]Ferry crossing Puget Sound, Seattle.© Dwight Smith/Shutterstock.com[ML31] Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac), 13 miles (21 km) south of the city centre, is a major gateway connecting Asia, Europe, and North America and is among the leading U.S. airports in international passenger travel. It is served by dozens of airlines (including Alaska Airlines, headquartered in the city), many of which are cargo carriers. Other modes of transport include bus lines and a rail system served by three large intermodal rail yards within the greater Seattle area. Several Amtrak passenger routes connect Seattle with cities in Oregon and California and with points east as far as Chicago. A light rail system began servicing Seattle and the surrounding region in 2009. The city’s 1-mile (1.6-km) monorail, introduced at the World’s Fair in 1962, is a popular tourist attraction and provides fast transportation between Seattle Center and the downtown shopping area.[P32] Page 1 of 2 Next page Administration and society
Washington"Spokane"City"Spokane county"eastern Washington"Spokane, city, seat (1879) of Spokane county, eastern Washington, U.S., at the falls of the Spokane River. Frequented by trappers when the North West Company built a trading post there in 1810, the site was settled in 1872 and laid out in 1878. Known as Spokane Falls (for the Spokane Indians, whose name means “sun people”), it developed after the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway. Abundant waterpower and a rich hinterland (minerals, forests, and agriculture) encouraged growth as a trade and shipping point for an area (comprising eastern Washington, northern Idaho, northeastern Oregon, western Montana, and southern British Columbia) known as the “Inland Empire.” A disastrous fire destroyed much of the city in 1889. It was rebuilt and was reincorporated under its present name in 1900. Lumber, metal, and food-processing industries were established. Development of the nearby Coeur d’Alene mineral field (gold, silver, uranium, and copper, among others) and completion of the Grand Coulee Dam Project (1941) assured the city’s financial and industrial growth. Fairchild Air Force Base and the establishment of aluminum reduction and rolling mills (during World War II) have contributed to the economy. The city’s Riverfront Park was the site of Expo ’74.

The bay was the starting point (1841) of a U.S. surveying party led by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, who named it Commencement Bay. Settled in 1864, the site was laid out (1868) as Commencement City by General Morton M. McCarver; it was soon renamed Tacoma (an Indian name for Mount Rainier, 45 miles [72 km] southeast). Sawmills and port facilities were established, and in 1873 the Northern Pacific Railway arrived and built a terminus called New Tacoma. The two communities merged in 1883.[P1]TacomaTacoma, Washington.© Chris Boswell/Fotolia[ML1]Tacoma is a lumber-processing centre. Although its chief industries are still lumber-based, the city contains shipyards, smelters, foundries, electrochemical plants, and food-processing factories. Docks and wharves line its waterfront. A gateway to Mount Rainier National Park, it is also connected to the Olympic Peninsula recreation areas via the second Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950).

Washington"Walla Walla"City"Walla Walla county"southeastern Washington"Walla Walla, city, seat (1859) of Walla Walla county, southeastern Washington, U.S. It lies along the Walla Walla River, near the Oregon state line. The American pioneer Marcus Whitman established a medical mission in the locality in 1836 and worked with the Cayuse Indians until he was massacred with his group in 1847 (marked by the Whitman Mission National Historic Site [1940]). A military post, Fort Walla Walla, was established on the site of the present-day city in 1856, and a settlement grew up around it. This settlement was first named Steptoeville (after Lieutenant Colonel Edward J. Steptoe, who led a command in the 1850s Indian wars) but was incorporated as Walla Walla (reportedly a Nez Percé word meaning “small rapid rivers”). The Idaho gold rush of 1861 brought an influx of pioneers who turned to ranching and agriculture. In 1875 the Walla Walla and Columbia River Railroad was completed.[P1]Walla Walla: Whitman CollegeMemorial Building, Whitman College, Walla Walla, Washington.Molly Knell[ML1]The city eventually became the centre of an extensive wheat- and truck-farming area and developed food-processing and lumber industries, with port facilities for Columbia River barges.

West Virginia"Bath"Town"Morgan county"in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia"Bath, also called Berkeley Springs, town, seat (1820) of Morgan county, in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia, U.S., near the Potomac River. Probably the oldest spa in the nation, it was chartered in 1776 and officially named Bath for the famous English watering place; its post-office name, however, is Berkeley Springs. George Washington first visited there in 1748 as a surveyor for Thomas Fairfax, 6th Baron Fairfax, who then owned vast tracts of land in the region. Washington returned frequently, often with his family, and most likely it was at his prompting that Lord Fairfax granted the lands around the springs to the colony of Virginia (1756). In 1784 inventor James Rumsey secretly demonstrated for Washington and a few others the steamboat he later tested again in Shepherdstown. Virginia’s American Revolutionary War wounded were treated in Bath, and it remained a popular resort until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861.[P1]Bath: Berkeley CastleBerkeley Castle, Bath, W.Va.Jeanne Mozier/The Washington Heritage Trail[ML1]The historic warm springs (74 °F [23 °C]), in Berkeley Springs State Park, remain popular for whirlpool therapy and other treatments.

The nearby Pocahontas coalfield brought an influx of miners to the area beginning in 1883, and in 1888 the Norfolk and Western Railway established yards in the town. The railroad and coal are still the economic mainstays, although food production, the manufacture of wood products, and tourism also are important. The Science Center of West Virginia (1994) is located in Bluefield. Bluefield State College (1895), a historically African American college, also has branches in Beckley and Welch.

Laid out in 1786 by George Washington’s youngest brother, Charles, it early became the residence of some of Virginia’s most aristocratic families. By the end of the 18th century it had become the educational centre of western Virginia with the founding of the Charles Town Academy for Boys in 1787 and a similar institution for girls a few years later. The abolitionist John Brown was tried and hanged there in 1859 following his raid on nearby Harpers Ferry. In 1922 the courthouse, used as a change of venue from Logan and Mingo counties, was the site of a trial regarding mining labour unrest; the trials that were held in Charles Town and other cities resulted in a decline of mine labour unionization until the mid-1930s. Charles Town was badly damaged during the American Civil War, but in 1871 it again became the county seat (which had been moved to Shepherdstown) after the courthouse was repaired.[P1]Charles TownHappy Retreat, Charles Town, W.Va.Jeanne Mozier/The Washington Heritage Trail[ML1]Mainly residential, Charles Town also has Thoroughbred racing.

Clendenin built Fort Lee there in 1788, and the town was chartered in 1794; first named Charles Town, for Clendenin’s father, it was renamed Charleston in 1819. Because it lay on the migration route to the Ohio River valley, the settlement soon became a transshipment point and attracted such frontier figures as Daniel Boone, Simon Kenton, and Ann Bailey. The town utilized local brine wells as early as 1795 and was an important centre of salt production in 1824, when the first steamboat arrived.[P2]During the American Civil War, Union general Joseph A.J. Lightburn was forced back to Charleston from Fayetteville to the southeast on September 11, 1862. Two days later Confederate general William Loring defeated Lightburn there and occupied Charleston for almost two months. Confederate forces took salt supplies and other goods from the Kanawha River valley, destroying most of the saltworks as they departed. Charleston was nominated as the state capital in 1870, but it took seven years and a popular vote before the capital moved there permanently.[P3]Charleston lies in an area rich in bituminous coal, petroleum, and natural gas as well as salt, and at one time these resources supplied a large chemical manufacturing industry in the Kanawha River valley. Nylon, Lucite, and other base chemicals used to produce consumer plastics were developed in the area. Chemicals are still important, though the economy is now more diversified, with an emphasis on manufacturing and on other services (government and health care).[P4]The State Capitol, designed by architect Cass Gilbert and completed in 1932, features a gold-leafed dome that is larger than that of the United States Capitol. The Capitol complex contains the governor’s mansion, the cultural centre, the state museum, and a memorial to Booker T. Washington, who grew up in nearby Malden.

West Virginia"Clarksburg"City"Harrison county"northern West Virginia"Clarksburg, city, seat of Harrison county, northern West Virginia, U.S. The city lies along the West Fork River. Settled in 1772, it was named for General George Rogers Clark, a noted Virginia frontiersman. Shortly thereafter Thomas Nutter arrived and built a fort near the site where the town of Nutter Fort (now a southeastern suburb) developed. Clarksburg was chartered as a town in 1785, although it had served as the county seat of Harrison since the formation of the county in 1784. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which arrived in 1856, brought economic prosperity, as did the opening of coalfields (1870) and oil fields (1889) nearby. Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson, the Confederate military leader, was born there in 1824, as was John W. Davis (1873), a lawyer, diplomat, and 1924 presidential candidate.[P1]ClarksburgClarksburg, W.Va.Tim Kiser[ML1]During the American Civil War, Clarksburg was the headquarters (1861) of General George B. McClellan, who was charged with holding what was then western Virginia for the Union. The town was also an important Union supply base. On April 22, 1861, Clarksburg held the first meeting in the process leading to the formation of the state of West Virginia in 1863.[P2]Clarksburg’s economy—formerly based on coal mining, oil and natural-gas production, and agriculture—has shifted more toward light manufactures and services. A significant addition to the regional economy is the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s large fingerprint-identification facility, which opened in 1995. A branch campus of Fairmont State College is in Clarksburg.

The original settlement (1793), near the Scioto-Monongahela Indian Trail, was incorporated in 1820 as Middletown, which merged in 1843 with nearby Palatine to form Fairmont. The arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the mid-19th century provided the impetus to open the first commercial mine (1854) in the rich Monongahela River valley bituminous coalfield. The founder of the mine, James Otis Watson, is now considered the father of the West Virginia coal industry.

When the town was part of Virginia, it was the site of the Harpers Ferry Raid, one of the major incidents precipitating the American Civil War, and of several battles of the war.[P1]Harpers Ferry, W.Va., at the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers.WV Department Of Commerce[ML1]The town was settled in 1734 by Robert Harper, who established a ferry across the Potomac and a grist mill on the Shenandoah. The site was selected by President George Washington for a federal armoury because of its waterpower potential and was purchased from Harper’s heirs in 1796. The town developed as an important U.S. arsenal and centre for the manufacture of rifles. In the 1830s the arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal turned the town into a commercial hub for a time.[P2]On October 16–18, 1859, the arsenal of Harpers Ferry was the target of an assault by an armed band of abolitionists led by John Brown. The raid was intended to be the first stage in an elaborate plan to establish an independent stronghold of freed slaves in the mountains of Maryland and Virginia—an enterprise that had won moral and financial support from several prominent Bostonians. Choosing Harpers Ferry because of its arsenal and its location as a convenient gateway to the South, Brown and his band of 16 whites and 5 blacks seized the armoury on the night of October 16. The entire countryside was quickly alerted, and combined state and federal troops overwhelmed the raiders in two days. Seventeen men died in the fighting, including two of Brown’s own sons; Brown and six surviving followers, after being tried at Charles Town, were hanged before the end of the year. Although the raid on Harpers Ferry was denounced by a majority of Northerners, it outraged Southern slaveholders, who were already fearful of slave insurrections, and convinced them that abolitionists would stop at nothing to eradicate their “peculiar institution.”[P3]The John Brown Museum, Harpers Ferry, W.Va.WV Department Of Commerce[ML3]Once the war began Harpers Ferry served as an important link in the defense of Washington, D.C., and was repeatedly attacked by both Union and Confederate armies. The most notable battle occurred when Confederates under General Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson captured the town (September 13–15, 1862) and took more than 12,500 prisoners, the largest Union surrender in the war.[P4]In 1869 Storer College opened there as a coeducational, multiethnic institution. The college was chosen in 1906 by W.E.B. Du Bois as one of the sites for the annual meetings of the Niagara Movement, which was a precursor of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (1909).

Settled in 1780, it was early called Anglin’s Ford and then Booths Ferry until it was chartered in 1844 and named for Philip Pendleton Barbour, associate justice (1836–41) of the U.S. Supreme Court. Philippi is known primarily as the site of an important early battle of the American Civil War. Fought on June 3, 1861, the engagement was initiated by Union troops who, led by Colonel B.F. Kelley, were attempting to protect the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Locally the battle is called the Philippi Races because of the speed with which the Confederate forces under Colonel George A. Porterfield retreated. A marker at the site on Broaddus Hill, now on the campus of Alderson-Broaddus College, describes it as the “First Land Battle between North and South.”[P1]PhilippiPhilippi, W.Va.Valerius Tygart[ML1]Alderson-Broaddus College, a private, coeducational institution affiliated with the Baptist church, was founded as Broaddus College in 1871; it was moved to Philippi in 1909 and merged with Alderson Junior College in 1931.

The settlement developed around Fort Blair, built in 1774, and was chartered in 1794. On October 10, 1774, the Battle of Point Pleasant was fought. At the confluence of the two rivers, General Andrew Lewis and a band of Virginia frontiersmen defeated the allied Shawnee, Delaware, Mingo, Ottawa, and others under Shawnee leader Chief Cornstalk. That victory, which allowed the settlers to inhabit the area without threat of attack, is recognized by some historians as the first battle of the American Revolution because the Native Americans were supposedly incited by the British. In 1908 the U.S. Senate recognized the claim of the Battle of Point Pleasant as the first battle of the American Revolution over the claim of Lexington, Massachusetts.

After local forests were exhausted in the early 20th century, Eau Claire turned to manufacturing (notably, until the early 1990s, rubber tires). The modern economy is based on manufacturing (computer equipment, paper products, and electronics), food processing, and health care; it is also the trading centre for the surrounding agricultural (especially dairying) region. Chippewa Falls, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Eau Claire, is a centre of computer manufacturing and beer production. Eau Claire is the seat of Chippewa Valley Technical College (1912) and the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire (1916).

Ho-Chunk Nation (Winnebago) Indians were early inhabitants of the area. The city originated in 1785 as a French trading post, named for its location at the “bottom of the lake.” It was laid out in 1835 and settled the following year, and it attracted many German immigrants. The economy was originally based on lumbering and grain milling but is now diversified and depends primarily on dairy farming and manufacturing (machine tools, agricultural equipment, automotive parts, and outboard motors and other marine equipment). St. Paul’s Cathedral contains an excellent collection of wood carvings from Oberammergau, Germany. Galloway House and Village is a 30-room mansion (1880) surrounded by some two dozen historic buildings.

Wisconsin"Green Bay"City"Brown county"eastern Wisconsin"Green Bay, city, seat (1854) of Brown county, eastern Wisconsin, U.S. It is situated where the Fox River empties into Green Bay (an inlet of Lake Michigan), about 110 miles (180 km) north of Milwaukee. Green Bay’s metropolitan area includes the city of De Pere and the villages of Ashwaubenon, Howard, and Allouez.[P1]Green BayBrown County Courthouse, Green Bay, Wis.Royalbroil[ML1]Ho-Chunk Nation (Winnebago), Menominee, Fox, and Ojibwa Indians were early inhabitants of the region. The area was visited in 1634 by Jean Nicolet, a French explorer who named it La Baye Verte (“The Green Bay”) because of the greenish colour of the water. By 1655 a fur-trading post had been established, and Green Bay became the gateway to a trade route that connected the Fox, Wisconsin, and Mississippi rivers. In 1671 Claude-Jean Allouez, a Jesuit, founded a mission at De Pere, and two years later the French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet traveled through the bay and southward down the Fox on their journey to the Mississippi River. A fort built by the French (1717) at the mouth of the river became the heart of a small French Canadian fur-trading community until after the French and Indian War (1754–63), when the British took control of the area. British traders called the site Green Bay, and the French name was gradually dropped. The United States took possession after the War of 1812 and built Fort Howard (1816) within the present limits of Green Bay. The city was laid out in the 1830s, and Wisconsin’s earliest newspaper, the Green Bay Intelligencer, appeared in 1833. With the decline of the fur trade and the opening (1825) of the Erie Canal, Green Bay developed as a lumbering and agricultural centre.[P2]Papermaking is a primary industry in Green Bay; other manufacturing (papermaking machinery, furniture, and packaging materials), food processing (meat, cheese and other dairy products, and vegetables), health care, insurance, agriculture (dairying), trucking, and tourism (a large casino is nearby) also contribute to the economy. A Great Lakes port of entry with heavy shipping, the city has a large wholesale and distributing business.[P3]The city is famous for its National Football League team, the Green Bay Packers (founded 1919; since 1923 owned by a private nonprofit organization consisting of its fans), which plays its home games at Lambeau Field (opened 1957). An Oneida Indian reservation is adjacent to the city’s western side. The nearly 50-acre (20-hectare) Heritage Hill State Historical Park (opened 1977) contains some two dozen original and replica buildings depicting four historical eras—French influence (1672), the frontier fort period (1836), its small-town heritage (1871), and a Belgian farm (1905). The National Railroad Museum exhibits a wide collection of locomotives and equipment. Green Bay also features a botanical garden, a zoo, a children’s museum, and a museum of Oneida history.

Wisconsin"Hayward"City"Sawyer county"northwestern Wisconsin"Hayward, city, seat (1885) of Sawyer county, northwestern Wisconsin, U.S. It lies on the Namekagon River, in a lake region west of Chequamegon National Forest, about 75 miles (120 km) southeast of Superior. Ojibwa Indians occupied the area when French Canadian fur traders established posts there in the late 18th century. During the 1880s and ’90s it was a major logging centre, and the community—named for Anthony Judson Hayward, a lumber baron who built a sawmill on the river in 1882—grew with an influx of logging companies and the arrival of the railroad. Although the white pine forests had been depleted by 1900, the region’s many lakes and streams brought a thriving resort industry.[P1]Although there is still some manufacturing of wood products, tourism dominates the city’s modern economy. The area, with some 200 lakes, is a particularly popular destination for boating, swimming, fishing, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing. More than two dozen golf courses and a casino also draw vacationers to the area. Hayward hosts the annual Lumberjack World Championships (July), which commemorate the community’s logging history through competitive events such as chopping and log rolling, and the American Birkebeiner cross-country ski race (February), in which thousands of skiers compete. The National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame, which maintains records of the largest freshwater fish caught in the world, exhibits hundreds of fishing artifacts as well as a four-and-a-half-story fibreglass likeness of a muskellunge (musky; a type of pike), complete with an observation deck in the open jaw.

The nearby Milton House (1844), a national historic landmark, was a station on the Underground Railroad for runaway slaves and has been preserved as a museum. Because Janesville has some 2,000 acres (800 hectares) of parkland, it has been given the nickname “Wisconsin’s Park Place.” The city was the birthplace (1862) of Carrie Jacobs Bond, a composer of sentimental songs, and it was where she wrote one of her most popular songs, “I Love You Truly.” Inc. 1853.

Founded in 1835 by settlers from New York, it was first called Pike Creek, then was called Southport for its importance as a shipping centre, and in 1850 was renamed Kenosha, derived from the Potawatomi term for “pike,” or “pickerel.” It was a centre of social reform in the early 1840s; for example, the city was the site of the founding of the Wisconsin Phalanx, which in 1844 established a communal living experiment based on the principles of the French social theorist Charles Fourier in what is now the area of Ripon. The city also won authority from the legislature to establish a tax to support a local school, and in 1845 the first free public school in Wisconsin opened there. Kenosha was also the site of the last judicially sanctioned execution (1851) in Wisconsin (and the only execution after Wisconsin became a state); some 3,000 people gathered in the city to watch the execution of a resident convicted of killing his wife, and many believe that the execution sparked the legislature to abolish the death penalty in the state two years later.[P1]KenoshaKenosha History Center, Kenosha, Wis.Kenokewl[ML1]Kenosha has diversified manufactures, including musical instruments, tools, automobile engines, apparel, and metal products; food processing is also important.

After the American Civil War, Lake Geneva became known as the “Newport of the West,” a popular year-round resort for wealthy Chicago residents who built summer homes and estates on the lake and in the wooded hills. Many of those Chicagoans then lived in these homes year-round after their Chicago homes were destroyed in the famous fire of 1871.

Madison, Wisconsin’s second largest city, lies in the south-central part of the state, centred on an isthmus between Lakes Mendota and Monona (which, with Lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa to the southeast, form the “four lakes” group), about 75 miles (120 km) west of Milwaukee. Sauk, Fox, and Ho-Chunk Nation (Winnebago) Indians were early inhabitants of the area. It was founded by James Duane Doty, a former federal district judge and a land speculator who held large holdings in the area, in 1836 (a year of frenzied land speculation in the newly created Territory of Wisconsin) and was named for President James Madison, who had died that summer. That same year Doty persuaded the legislature to make Madison the permanent capital of Wisconsin and to establish a university there. The wooded site was still uninhabited, but construction of a capitol building was quickly begun, and late in 1838 the territorial legislature held its first session in a nearby building. Wisconsin became a state in 1848, and, through the efforts of Leonard J. Farwell, a wealthy businessman from Milwaukee, industries began to locate in the city about 1850. The railroad arrived in 1854, and steady development ensued. Read More on This Topic Wisconsin Madison, in south-central Wisconsin, is the state capital. READ MORE Governmental operations and the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1848) account for much of the city’s prosperity and form the basis of its economy. Madison is the trade centre of a large agricultural area (dairy products, corn [maize], soybeans, tobacco, and livestock). Food processing is a major industry, and the city is the headquarters for Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. Services (health care and insurance), printing, and manufacturing (truck trailers, medical equipment, and agricultural equipment) are also important. The city is also the site of the USDA Forest Service Forest Products Laboratory (1910).[P2]Madison is characterized by landscaped lakeshores, bicycle paths, and large parks, including Henry Vilas Park with the city zoo. Governor Nelson State Park on Lake Mendota, Lake Kegonsa State Park on Lake Kegonsa, the University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum on Lake Wingra, and Olbrich Botanical Gardens provide other outdoor recreational opportunities. The city’s skyline is dominated by the State Capitol (284.4 feet [86.7 metres] high), modeled after the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Its white granite dome is topped by a statue, Wisconsin; made of bronze by sculptor Daniel Chester French and covered in gold leaf, it symbolizes the state motto: “Forward.” It is in a 13-acre (5-hectare) park known as the Capitol Square. The square is the site of a popular farmers’ market, held weekly from May through October, as well as concerts and other events. The Monona Terrace Community and Convention Center (1997) overlooking Lake Monona is based on a 1938 design by Frank Lloyd Wright. Madison is the seat of the original campus of the University of Wisconsin, whose 930-acre (375-hectare) main campus includes an art museum, a geology museum, and a scenic lakeshore path.

French missionary and explorer Jacques Marquette camped there in 1674, and fur traders soon followed. The area was opened to settlement after agreements with the Native Americans in the 1830s. In 1835 three settlers bought land in the area and began an intense rivalry: Solomon Juneau, who had arrived in 1818, founded Juneautown north of the Menomonee River and east of the Milwaukee River; Byron Kilbourn founded Kilbourntown north of the Menomonee and west of the Milwaukee; and George Walker founded Walker’s Point, which did not begin to develop until 1850, south of the Menomonee. Juneau and Kilbourn constantly clashed on the building of streets and bridges, each purposely constructing them so that they would not line up with those of the other community. The situation climaxed in 1845 when three bridges were burned by angry mobs; the following year an agreement was signed to make Milwaukee a single community.[P2] Milwaukee grew as a manufacturing and distribution centre in the second half of the 19th century. Flour milling, leather tanning, and iron founding were all major industries. However, Milwaukee became best known for beer production, which began in 1840. German immigrants subsequently opened several large breweries and made Milwaukee a national centre of the industry. For a time the city was the region’s primary lake port for eastbound shipments, particularly wheat. With the arrival of the railroad and the growth of Chicago as a national rail hub, Milwaukee’s importance as a shipping point declined in the late 19th century.[P3] European immigration was largely responsible for Milwaukee’s growth. German settlers played an important and sustained part in the city’s development; a wave of immigration that occurred after Germany’s unsuccessful revolution in 1848 contributed wealthy and cultured refugees. As the city’s largest ethnic group, the Germans developed their own society that included schools, churches, and breweries. Irish formed the second largest group beginning in the mid-19th century. Large influxes of Poles and Italians occurred toward the end of the century. In 1910 immigrants or their children constituted some three-fourths of the city’s population. Although Europeans continued to arrive after 1900, the influx of African Americans from the South became increasingly significant.[P4] After the American Civil War the city found itself involved with labour unions, disputes, and strikes, which lasted until the turn of the 20th century. A Progressive-era reform movement brought Milwaukee a reputation for clean and efficient government. The city is also noted for having had three socialist mayors, Emil Seidel (1910–12), Daniel Webster Hoan (1916–40), and Frank P. Zeidler (1948–60).[P5]Map of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S. (c. 1900), from the 10th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica.Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.[ML5] Growth was slowed by the Great Depression of the 1930s, but armament production during World War II brought new prosperity. The city’s population, which had grown steadily for decades, reached a peak of some 750,000 in the mid-1960s, after which it gradually began to decline. The proportion of African American residents continued to rise and constituted nearly two-fifths of the city’s population by 2000. Milwaukee remained a leading manufacturing city until the 1980s, by which time many plants had closed; even beer production declined, and, at the beginning of the 21st century, only one major brewery remained in the city.[P6] [H3]The contemporary city Milwaukee subsequently developed a much more diversified economy, with services (including health care, finance and banking, and insurance) and high-technology industries becoming major factors. Manufacturing (including medical equipment, mining machinery, engines, leather goods, electronics, padlocks, and motorcycle parts), shipping, and brewing are still important; printing, food processing (including meat products and snack foods), and conventions and tourism also contribute to the economy. The Port of Milwaukee is open year-round and accessible to the largest ships using the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway; the major cargoes handled include steel, heavy machinery, and forest products.

The city, with adjoining Menasha to the north, forms one economic and social community. Menominee, Fox, and Ho-Chunk Nation (Winnebago) Indians were early inhabitants of the area, which was visited by French explorer Jean Nicolet in 1634. In 1673 the French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet traveled southward down the Fox and through Lake Winnebago on their journey to the Mississippi River. The city was first settled in 1835, but permanent settlement did not begin until 1843. It was originally called Winnebago Rapids and later renamed Neenah (a Native American word for “water”). Flour milling was an early enterprise, but, with the westward shift of wheat growing, the city turned to the manufacture of paper products, which continues to be a major industry. Other manufactures include packaging, electronics, and cast-iron products; printing and publishing are also important. The Bergstrom-Mahler Museum exhibits glass paperweights.

The earliest inhabitants of the region, known as the Old Copper culture, lived there some 5,000 years ago. Fur traders arrived in the early 17th century, and in 1669 the Jesuit missionary Claude-Jean Allouez established a mission at the site, which was then a Menominee Indian village. The locality’s name derives from an Indian settlement called Oak-a-Toe, meaning “place of the pickerel.” Oconto developed as a lumbering community; a steam-powered sawmill (1853) was among the first of its kind in the western United States. Brewing was also important. Oconto is the site of the world’s first Christian Science church, built in 1886. Tourism is important to the local economy; lumber, paper, and dairying interests contribute to the economy, and there is also some manufacturing (particularly boats) and food processing (notably pickles).

Potawatomi, Menominee, Ho-Chunk Nation (Winnebago), Fox, and Ojibwa Indians were early inhabitants of the region, which the French explorer Jean Nicolet visited in 1634. In the 1670s the Jesuit missionary Claude-Jean Allouez and the French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet traveled through the area. French fur traders were active in the area from the late 17th century, and the lake and river formed an important link in a trade route from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River. A trading post was established in 1818, and permanent settlement began in 1836, when the Menominee ceded their claims to the area. First called Athens, it was renamed in 1839 for a Menominee chief.

The 1.5-mile (2.5-km) overland portage there between the Wisconsin and Fox rivers was first crossed by the French explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette in 1673; the route was vital in linking the Great Lakes with the Mississippi River. The Portage Canal was built between the Fox and Wisconsin rivers in the 1850s, but it faced competition from a railroad that came through the town in 1857; the canal fell into disuse and was closed to navigation in 1951. In 1792 a fur-trading post was established, and Fort Winnebago was built in 1828 at the site when conflict with the Ho-Chunk Nation (Winnebago) Indians threatened; its Surgeon’s Quarters have been restored as a museum. The Historic Indian Agency House (1832) of John Kinzie, agent to the Winnebago, has also been restored.[P1]Modern Portage is the business centre of a diversified farming area (corn [maize], soybeans, and livestock) and has manufacturing (plastics, batteries, automotive accessories, and glass), food processing, and a state prison.

Fox, Sauk, and Ho-Chunk Nation (Winnebago) Indians were early inhabitants of the area. In 1673 the French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet traveled from Green Bay down the Fox and Wisconsin rivers to the Mississippi. In 1685 the French fur trader Nicolas Perrot established a fort near the city site. The British took over the area in 1763. Named for a Fox chief, Alim (“Dog,” or chien in French), it became known as Prairie du Chien. As the western terminus of the Fox-Wisconsin river route to the Mississippi River system, it was long a rendezvous for explorers, missionaries, and traders. The Americans built Fort Shelby there during the War of 1812 and Fort Crawford (where Black Hawk surrendered to the United States in 1832) in 1816. In 1820 Prairie du Chien became a depot for the American Fur Company.

It was disbanded in 1851 and absorbed in 1853 by the adjacent settlement of Ripon (founded 1849). The latter, named for Ripon in North Yorkshire, England, was incorporated in 1858 and became a stronghold of the abolition movement. On May 20, 1854, in a frame schoolhouse on the campus of Ripon College (founded in 1851, opened as a preparatory school in 1853, and reorganized as a college in 1863), antislavery members of the Democratic, Whig, and Free-Soil parties held a meeting at which a new political party was proposed. This was the origin of the Republican Party, which came to power in 1861 under Abraham Lincoln.

Potawatomi and Menominee Indians were among the early inhabitants of the area. Settled in 1835, the community was at first attached to the township of Milwaukee. Charles Hart, an early settler, used the river’s waterpower to establish a gristmill and a sawmill. In 1842 the community separated from Milwaukee and was named Wauwatosa, for the Potawatomi chief Wauwautaesie and the Potawatomi word for “firefly.” Primarily residential, the city has some manufacturing (notably engines and metal products) and serves as a distribution centre.

Potawatomi and Menominee Indians were among the early inhabitants of the region. In 1835 settlers from New York arrived and began farming along Honey Creek, for which the community was initially named. The growing Milwaukee area provided a market for the agricultural produce. The Chicago and North Western Railway reached the community in 1880 and called its station North Greenfield; in 1887 the community took the same name. The city’s growth was spurred by the siting within its boundaries in 1891 of the annual Wisconsin State Fair and by the arrival of streetcar lines from Milwaukee in 1894. It became an industrial centre; in 1902, after the arrival of the Edward P. Allis Company (manufacturers of heavy machinery), the city was renamed West Allis.[P1]Manufacturing (engines, metal products, and machinery) and services are the city’s economic mainstays.

Wisconsin"Wisconsin Dells"City""south-central Wisconsin"Wisconsin Dells, scenic region and city along the Wisconsin River, in Columbia, Sauk, Juneau, and Adams counties, south-central Wisconsin, U.S. The city of Wisconsin Dells is located about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Madison.[P1]The dells were formed by glacial meltwater that cut a channel as much as 150 feet (45 metres) deep through the sandstone and, in the process, carved unusual rock formations along a 15-mile (25-km) stretch of the Wisconsin River. Early rivermen gave the dramatic shapes descriptive names such as Black Hawk’s Head and Chimney Rock. The most famous rock formation is Stand Rock. A dam divides the Wisconsin River into the Upper and Lower Dells, which may be viewed from the river and are accessible by footpaths. Native American tribes in the area during presettlement times included the Sauk, Menominee, and Ho-Chunk Nation (Winnebago).[P2]The first permanent settlers began arriving in 1838. The economy was based on logging, spurred by the building of a bridge across the Wisconsin River in 1850 (washed away in 1866). The completion of a dam (1853) and a railroad bridge (1857; burned 1866) further encouraged the growth of mills and settlements in the second half of the 19th century. Initially named Kilbourn in honour of the president of the railroad, the city was renamed in 1931. It is now a tourist centre for the surrounding region; local attractions include Storybook Gardens, Noah’s Ark, Riverview Park and Waterworld, and Wisconsin Deer Park.

The region was prime hunting ground for Sioux, Arapaho, and Cheyenne Indians, and many armed conflicts ensued as settlers moved into the area. Forts were established to protect miners and other white travelers on the Bozeman Trail; these were abandoned in 1868, but white settlement was not far in the future. Founded in 1879 on a buffalo trail that forded the creek, the community that became Buffalo soon saw considerable conflict between farmers and cattlemen, and the site of the final battle in the Johnson County Cattle War (1892) is 13 miles (21 km) south at the TA Ranch.[P1]BuffaloBuffalo, Wyoming.Acroterion[ML1]Buffalo is a shipping point for livestock and lumber, with grain and sugar beet cultivation and oil wells in the vicinity.

It originated around Fort Caspar at the site of a pioneer crossing on the Oregon Trail and the Pony Express route. The fort, now restored, was named for Lieutenant Caspar Collins, who was slain by Indians in 1865 while trying to rescue a stranded wagon train. The California, Overland, and Oregon trails met near the site of Casper’s establishment. Founded in 1888 as a tent town before the arrival of the Chicago and North Western Railway, the town was named Casper (a misspelling of Collins’s name) by clerical error. In the 1890s the Salt Creek Oil Field, just north, established the town’s oil business. The oil fields include Teapot Dome, centre of the scandal that rocked the administration of President Warren G. Harding in 1922.[P1]CasperFort Caspar Museum, Casper, Wyo.Matthew Trump[ML1]At the turn of the 21st century, Casper’s economy was based on the production of oil and natural gas and the manufacture of oil-field equipment, augmented by mining (uranium, coal, bentonite) and cattle and sheep raising. Ranching continues to be important, but the contemporary city mainly depends on a service economy. Casper is the trading centre for a large hinterland and is the seat of Casper College (1945; two-year). Casper Mountain Park and Medicine Bow National Forest are to the southeast.

Squatters arriving in 1867 just ahead of the Union Pacific Railroad named the place for the Cheyenne Indians; they were removed from the railroad’s land grant by federal troops. In the 1870s the town became an outfitting point for the Black Hills goldfields to the northeast and a major shipping point for cattle from Texas. Its own grazing lands became famed for Hereford herds and wealthy cattle barons. Peopled by gunmen, gamblers, and transients, Cheyenne developed a low reputation during the days of the Vigilantes and the war between cattlemen and sheepmen.[P1]CheyenneThe State Capitol, Cheyenne, Wyo.Matthew Trump[ML1]The city is now a trade and distribution centre for the middle Rocky Mountain region.
